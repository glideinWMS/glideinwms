# GlideinWMS

The purpose of the GlideinWMS is to provide a simple way to access the Grid resources. GlideinWMS is a Glidein Based WMS (Workload Management System) that works on top of HTCondor. Glideins are like placeholders, a mechanism by which one or more remote resources temporarily join a local HTCondor pool. The HTCondor system is used for scheduling and job control.
