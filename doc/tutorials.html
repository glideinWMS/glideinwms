        <h2>Submitting with a VO Frontend</h2>
        These examples assumes you have GlideinWMS installation running and as a
        user, you have access to submit jobs. Make sure you have sourced the
        correct HTCondor installation.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>NOTE:</b> It is recommended that you always provide a VOMS proxy in
        the user job submission. A proxy may also be required for other reasons,
        such as the job staging data.
        <br />
        <br />
        The GlideinWMS environment looks almost exactly like a regular, local
        HTCondor pool. It just does not have any resources attached unless you
        ask for them; try
        <pre>$ condor_status</pre>
        and you can see that no glideins are connected to your local pool. The
        GlideinWMS system will submit glideins on your behalf when they are
        needed. Some information may need to be specified in order for you get
        glideins that can run your jobs. Depending on your VO Frontend
        configuration, you may also have to specify additional requirements.
        <br />
        <br />

        <h4>Submitting a simple job with no requirements</h4>
        Here is a generic job that calculates Pi using the monte carlo method.
        First create a file called pi.py and make it executable:
        <pre>
#!/bin/env python
from random import *
from math import sqrt,pi
from sys import argv
inside=0
n=int(argv[1])
for i in range(0,n):
    x=random()
    y=random()
    if sqrt(x*x+y*y)<=1:
        inside+=1
pi_prime=4.0*inside/n
print pi_prime, pi-pi_prime
    </pre
        >
        You can run it:
        <pre>
$ ./pi.py 1000000
3.1428 -0.00120734641021
    </pre
        >
        The first number is the approximation of pi. The second number is how
        far from the real pi it is. If you repeat this, you will see how the
        result changes every time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, let's submit this as a HTCondor job. Because we are going to run
        this multiple times (100), it will actually be a bunch of jobs. These
        jobs should run everywhere, so we won't need to specify any additional
        requirements. Create the submit file and call it myjob.sh:
        <pre>
Universe   = vanilla
Executable = pi.py
Arguments  = 10000000
Requirements = (Arch=!="")
Log        = job.$(Cluster).log
Output   = job.$(Cluster).$(Process).out
Error      = job.$(Cluster).$(Process).err
should_transfer_files   = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
Queue 100
    </pre
        >
        Next submit the job:
        <pre>$ condor_submit myjob.sh</pre>
        The VO Frontend is monitoring the job queue and user collector. When it
        sees your jobs and that there are no glideins, it will ask the Factory
        to provide some. Once the glideins start and contact your user
        collector, you can see them by running
        <pre>$ condor_status</pre>
        HTCondor will match your jobs to the glideins and the jobs will then
        run. You can monitor the status of your user jobs by running
        <br />
        <pre>$ condor_q</pre>
        Once the jobs have finished, you can view the output in the
        job.$(Cluster).$(Process).out files.
        <br />
        <br />

        <h4>Understanding where jobs are running</h4>
        While your jobs can run everywhere, you may still want to know where
        they actually ran; possibly because you want to know who to thank for
        the CPUs you were consuming, or to debug problems you had with your
        program.
        <br />
        <br />
        To do this, we add some additional attributes to the submit file:
        <pre>
Universe   = vanilla
Executable = pi.py
Arguments  = 50000000
Requirements = (Arch=!="")
Log        = job.$(Cluster).log
Output   = job.$(Cluster).$(Process).out
Error      = job.$(Cluster).$(Process).err
should_transfer_files   = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
+JOB_Site = "$$(GLIDEIN_Site:Unknown)"
+JOB_Gatekeeper = "$$(GLIDEIN_Gatekeeper:Unknown)"
Queue 100
    </pre
        >
        These additional attributes in the job are used by the VO Frontend to
        find sites that match these requirements. HTCondor also uses them to
        match your jobs to the right glideins.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now submit the job cluster as before. You can monitor the running jobs
        with:
        <pre>
$ condor_q `id -un` -const 'JobStatus==2' -format '%d.' ClusterId -format '%d ' ProcId -format '%s\n' MATCH_EXP_JOB_Site
    </pre
        >
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="user_jobs">
        <h2><a name="submit">Submitting user jobs</a></h2>

        From the user point of view, this is just a regular HTCondor pool.<br /><br />

        However, since the resources potentially come from all over the world,
        users need to create more complex <b>Requirements</b> line in their JDL,
        in order to prevent the jobs from landing on sites that cannot run their
        jobs.<br /><br />
        Users will need to know which attributes the glideins publish and use
        them accordingly. One useful attribute that all glideins publish is
        GLIDEIN_Site. If a user wants to restrict its job to a list of sites, he
        can do it by using:
        <blockquote>
          +DESIRED_Sites = "Site1,Site4,Site7,Site22"<br />
          Requirements = stringListMember(GLIDEIN_Site,DESIRED_Sites)
        </blockquote>

        Some glideins may also need to properly identify the final user, using
        GSI authentication. A user should thus add the following line:
        <blockquote>
          x509userproxy = <i>&lt;path to X509 proxy&gt;</i>
        </blockquote>

        to their HTCondor submission file.
