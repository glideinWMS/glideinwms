<h2><a name="implementation"></a>Implementation details</h2>

<h3><a name="glidein_daemons"></a>The Glidein Factory Daemon</h3>

<p>The Glidein Factory is composed of several entry points. The
Factory Daemon is really just a small process tasked to start and
monitor the Factory Entry Daemons. See picture in the 
<a href="#entry_daemons">next section</a> for a logical overview.</p>
<p>All daemons of a Glidein Factory share the same directory tree.
The root of the tree contains the main configuration files used by
the Factory daemon.</p>
<p>More details about the Glidein Factory Daemon internals can be
found <a href="design_factory.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="entry_daemons"></a>The Factory Entry Daemons</h3>
<p>The Glidein Factory is composed of several Factory Entry Daemons,
each advertising itself and processing the incoming requests. See the
picture below for a logical overview.

</p>
<img src="../images/entry_points_overview.png" name="graphics2" width="80%" align="BOTTOM" border="0/">
<p>All daemons of a Glidein Factory share the same directory tree. The root
of the tree contains the common startup and configuration files,
while each entry point has a few additional configuration files on
its own. Each entry point is completely described by these files on
disk; the Factory Entry Daemons only extract information about entry
point attributes and supported parameters needed for advertising.
When glidein jobs are submitted, only the frontend provided
parameters need to be given to the glidein startup script, as the
script itself will autonomously gather all the other
information.

</p>
<p>More details about the Factory Entry Daemon
internals can be found <a href="design_entry.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="glidein_startup"></a>The glidein startup script</h3>
<p>As said in the <a href="../index.html#glideins">overview</a>,&nbsp;
a glidein is essentially a properly configured Condor startd.
However, somebody needs to do that configuration. So we need a job
startup script that will do the work.<br><br>A startup script needs
to perform several tasks:</p>

<ul>
    <li>check that the working environment on the worker node is
    reasonable (else user jobs will fail) </li>

    <li>obtain the Condor binaries </li>
    <li>configure Condor </li>
    <li>prepare the environment for Condor </li>
    <li>start Condor </li>

</ul>
<p>Given the complexity of the task, and for the sake of flexibility,
it makes sense to split the script in several pieces. So the glidein
job is composed of several pieces, including the startup script
pieces, the Condor binaries, and a base configuration file.
</p>
<p>
    However, having a Grid job with data files can represent a
challenge; each Grid flavor treats data in a different way!

</p>
<p>
    To make the system as general as possible, the Glidein Factory
requires the use of a Web Server to distribute its data. This version
of the Glide based Factory was tested with 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>
and <a href="http://www.stllinux.org/meeting_notes/2001/0719/tux/index.html">TUX</a>,
but any other web server should work just well, as only static file
delivery is required.
</p>
<p>

    A general overview of how a glidein
starts up is given in the picture below.</p>
<img src="../images/glidein_script.png" name="graphics3" width="80%" align="BOTTOM" border="0/">
<p>
The task of the basic startup script (called <tt><b>glidein_startup.sh</b></tt>)
is thus reduced to loading the other files, including the support
scripts, the base config files and the Condor binaries. The list of
files to load is obtained from the Web server as one of the first
steps, making the startup script completely generic.<br><br>Please
notice two things. First, all the files transfered over the Web are
signed using <tt><b>sha1sum</b></tt>. This
prevents a hacker from tampering with the files while in transit.
This is especially important for executables and scripts (to prevent
arbitrary code to be executed), but is useful for configuration files
too.</p>

<p>The signature checking is implemented in two steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The signature of all the files to be transfered is saved in a
    file called <tt><b>signature.sha1</b></tt> and
    stored on the Web server. The signature of the signature file is
    then passed as one of the parameters to the startup script.</li> 
    <li>The startup script loads the signature file from the Web
    server and verifies its signature. All other downloads, including
    the file containing the list of other files, is checked against the
    values in the signature file. See the pseudo-code below.</li>

<pre>wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/signature.sha1
sha1sum <i>known_sha1</i> signature.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 1
fi
grep files_list signature.sha1 &gt; filelist.sha1
wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/files_list.lst
sha1sum -c filelist.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 2
fi
for file in files_list.lst do
 wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/$file
done
sha1sum -c signature.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 3
fi

<i>launch scripts</i></pre>
</ol>
<p>The second point I would like to stress are the advantages that
come from using standard Web technologies. Web technologies are
widely used nowadays and there is a plethora of tools that can be
readily used. In our case, we can reduce the network load and speed
startup times by using a Web cache near the worker nodes, if
available. The Glidein Factory was tested with 
<a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a>,
but other products should work as well. It is also worth mentioning
that both OSG and gLite has expressed interest in deploying a Squid
server on every Grid site.<br><br>More details about the startup
script internals and support scripts provided by the current
implementation can be found <a href="design_glidein.html">here</a>.</p>
