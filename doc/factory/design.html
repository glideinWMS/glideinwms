        <h2><a name="overview"></a>Glidein Factory Overview</h2>
        <p>
          A <a href="index.html">Glidein Factory</a> is composed of a Factory
          Daemon and several Factory Entry Daemons. Each Entry Daemon is
          autonomous; it advertises itself and processes the incoming requests.
          The main Factory Daemon just launches and monitors the Factory Entry
          Daemons.
        </p>

        <p>In the section below, each components will be described.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2><a name="components"></a>Factory Components</h2>

        The factory is made of several parts, which each have their own section
        on their design.

        <h3><a name="glidein_daemons"></a>The Glidein Factory Daemon</h3>

        <p>
          Also, the Glidein Factory is composed of several entry points. The
          Factory Daemon is really just a small process tasked to start and
          monitor the Factory Entry Daemons. See picture in the
          <a href="#entry_daemons">next section</a> for a logical overview.
        </p>
        <p>
          All daemons of a Glidein Factory share the same directory tree, which
          root contains the main configuration files used by the Factory daemon.
        </p>
        <p>
          More details about the Glidein Factory Daemon internals can be found
          <a href="design_factory.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3><a name="entry_daemons"></a>The Factory Entry Daemons</h3>
        <p>
          The Glidein Factory is composed of several Factory Entry Daemons, each
          advertising itself and processing the incoming requests. See the
          picture below for a logical overview.
        </p>
        <img

          width="80%"
          align="BOTTOM"
          border="0/"
        />
        <p>
          As explained previously, the root of the tree contains the common
          startup and configuration files, while each entry point has a few
          additional configuration files on its own. Each entry point is
          completely described by these files on disk; the Factory Entry Daemons
          only extract information about entry point attributes and supported
          parameters needed for advertising. When glidein jobs are submitted,
          only the Frontend provided parameters need to be given to the glidein
          startup script, as the script itself will autonomously gather all the
          other information.
        </p>
        <p>
          More details about the Factory Entry Daemon internals can be found
          <a href="design_entry.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3><a name="glidein_startup"></a>The glidein startup script</h3>
        <p>
          As said in the <a href="../index.html#glideins">overview</a>,&nbsp; a
          glidein is essentially a properly configured HTCondor startd. However,
          somebody needs to do that configuration. So we need a job startup
          script that will do the work.<br /><br />A startup script needs to
          perform several tasks:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            check that the working environment on the worker node is reasonable
            (else user jobs will fail)
          </li>

          <li>obtain the HTCondor binaries</li>
          <li>configure HTCondor</li>
          <li>prepare the environment for HTCondor</li>
          <li>start HTCondor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Given the complexity of the task and for the sake of flexibility, it
          makes sense to split the script in several pieces. Thus, the glidein
          job is composed of several pieces, including the startup script
          pieces, the HTCondor binaries, and a base configuration file.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, having a Grid job with data files can represent a challenge;
          each Grid flavor treats data in a different way!
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the system as general as possible, the Glidein Factory
          requires the use of a Web Server to distribute its data. This version
          of the Glidein based Factory was tested with
          <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>
          and
          <a
            href="http://www.stllinux.org/meeting_notes/2001/0719/tux/index.html"
            >TUX</a
          >, but any other web server should work just well, as only static file
          delivery is required.
        </p>
        <p>
          A general overview of how a glidein starts up is given in the picture
          below.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/glidein_script.png"
          name="graphics3"
          width="80%"
          align="BOTTOM"
          border="0/"
        />
        <p>
          The task of the basic startup script (called
          <tt><b>glidein_startup.sh</b></tt
          >) is thus reduced to loading the other files including the support
          scripts, the base config files and the HTCondor binaries. The list of
          files to load is obtained from the Web server as one of the first
          steps, making the startup script completely generic.<br /><br />Please
          notice two things. First, all the files transfered over the Web are
          signed using <tt><b>sha1sum</b></tt
          >. This prevents a hacker from tampering with the files while in
          transit. This is especially important for executables and scripts (to
          prevent arbitrary code to be executed), but is useful for
          configuration files too.
        </p>

        <p>The signature checking is implemented in two steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The signature of all the files to be transfered is saved in a file
            called <tt><b>signature.sha1</b></tt> and stored on the Web server.
            The signature of the signature file is then passed as one of the
            parameters to the startup script.
          </li>
          <li>
            The startup script loads the signature file from the Web server and
            verifies its signature. All other downloads, including the file
            containing the list of other files, is checked against the values in
            the signature file. See the pseudo-code below.

            <pre>wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/signature.sha1
sha1sum <i>known_sha1</i> signature.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 1
fi
grep files_list signature.sha1 &gt; filelist.sha1
wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/files_list.lst
sha1sum -c filelist.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 2
fi
for file in files_list.lst do
 wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/$file
done
sha1sum -c signature.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 3
fi

<i>launch scripts</i></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The second point I would like to stress, are the advantages that come
          from using standard Web technologies. Web technologies are widely used
          nowadays and there is a plethora of tools that can be readily used. In
          our case, we can reduce the network load and speed startup times by
          using a Web cache near the worker nodes, if available. The Glidein
          Factory was tested with
          <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a>, but other products
          should work as well. It is also worth mentioning that both OSG and
          gLite has expressed interest in deploying a Squid server on every Grid
          site.<br /><br />More details about the startup script internals and
          support scripts provided by the current implementation can be found
          <a href="design_glidein.html">here</a>.
