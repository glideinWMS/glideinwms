        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This document describes what configuration variables are used by the
          glideins. Most administrators never need to touch most of them, but a
          sophisticated Glidein Factory administrator may need to tweak some of
          them to implement the desired policies (for example: require
          encryption over the wire) or to address the needs of a particular site
          (for example: max allowed wallclock time).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2><a name="location"></a>Configuration variable location</h2>
        <p>
          The GlideinWMS ships with a set of pre-defined configuration
          variables, that are stored in two files (known as
          <i>condor vars files)</i>:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          glideinWMS/creation/web_base/condor_vars.lst<br />
          glideinWMS/creation/web_base/condor_vars.lst.entry
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The two files are equivalent, but were split for historical reasons,
          and the second one is meant to contain site specific configuration
          variables.<br /><b
            >These files should never be modified, and represent just the
            default shipped by the software!</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          A GlideinWMS administrator can change the values of the predefined
          variables (with some exceptions, see <a href="#dyn_vars">below</a>),
          and define new ones using the
          <a href="configuration.html#args">Glidein Factory configuration</a>
          file.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2><a name="condor_vars"></a>HTCondor vars files</h2>
        <p>
          The condor vars files contain the GlideinWMS pre-defined configuration
          variables, and <b>should never be modified</b>.<br />However, a
          GlideinWMS administrator should nevertheless be able to read them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of them is an ASCII file, with one entry per row. <br />Lines
          starting with # are comments and are ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each non comment line must have 7 columns. Each column has a specific
          meaning:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Attribute name</li>

          <li>
            Attribute type
            <ul>
              <li>I (int) &ndash; integer</li>

            in the configuration used by HTCondor daemons
          </li>
          <li>
            Is a value required for this attribute? <br />Must be Y or N. If Y
            and the attribute is not defined, the glidein will fail.
          </li>
          <li>
            Will condor_startd publish this attribute to the collector?<br />Must
            be Y or N.
          </li>
          <li>
            Will the attribute be exported to the user job environment?
            <ul>
              <li>- - Do not export (for glidein/condor internal use)</li>

              <li>

        </h3>
        <p>
          This section presents variables that can be directly changed by a
          Glidein Factory administrator using attr tags in the Factory
          configuration XML using the following tags:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <b>&lt;attr name</b>=&ldquo;<i>name</i>&rdquo;
          <b>value</b>=&ldquo;<i>val</i>&rdquo;

          <b>type</b>=&ldquo;<i>type</i>&rdquo; ...<b>/&gt;</b>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Attr tags can be in both the Factory and Frontend configuration,
          available types are <i>Int</i> (I in HTCondor vars file),
          <i>String</i> (S) or <i>Expr</i> (C). String and Expr values are
          treated literally (no need to escape them) and Strings are quoted when
          passed to HTCondor.
        </p>
        <p>
          More information on the XML format can be found in
          <a href="configuration.html#args">Glidein Factory configuration</a>
          section.
          <br />
          If not specified in the XML, most of these variables have defaults set
          in <i>condor vars</i> files, which are used if the Glidein Factory
          administrator does not override them. These defaults are listed below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please also note that some of these variables may also be provided by
          the VO clients (e.g. Frontends). See the sections below.

                main slots (type is <tt>main</tt> or <tt>extra</tt>): the memory
                and disk parameters are ignored; HTCondor splits automatically
                resources depending on the number of CPUs and having a
                partitionable main slot or not; if the number of resources is
                not equal (or an exact multiple) to the number of CPUs, then you
                must select partitionable slots for the Glideins (<tt

                SLOTS_LAYOUT partitionable in the Frontend configuration)
                otherwise the startd may fail due to impossible configuration.
                When adding resources to the main slots, regular jobs (not using
                the resource) may use all memory and CPUs (including the virtual
                ones). Only separate slots (type is <tt>partitionable</tt> or
                <tt>static</tt>) reserve CPUs and memory.
                <!--,
        e.g. when you add 3 units of a resource to a node with 8 CPUs divided statically in 8 main slots, the first 3 of them will have also your resource.

                Number of CPUs glidein should use. GLIDEIN_CPUS is used to set

                "<b>slot</b>" (or "<b>auto</b>") to let glidein determine this
                from the job slot assigned to the glidein, use "<b>node</b>" to
                let glidein determine this from the hardware of the worker node
                (e.g. if you are sure that only your job is running on the
                node), use a positive integer to set GLIDEIN_CPUS (and NUM_CPUS)
                to assume that value. Most of the time it is an integer, but the
                type is string to allow also the keywords. In case of static
                partitioning, glidein will create GLIDEIN_CPUS number of slots.
                In case of dynamic partitioning, the slots will be created
                automatically based on the CPUs required by the job and
                GLIDEIN_CPUS is the sum of the slots made available. Refer to

                used to select the platform: the first platform in the list that
                matches a key will be used. You can use any string to identify
                the images as lons as you are consistent with REQUIRED_OS, but
                we recommend to use standard names like: rhel7 (for RHEL7 or
                SL7), rhel6 (fpr RHEL6 or SL6). The default set in

                This is used to set Singularity bind mounts. It is a comma
                separated list of <tt>src[:dst[:opt]]</tt> elements, as you
                would express in the --bind option in Singularity. 'src' is the
                path on the system, 'dst' is the path in the Singularity image,
                'opt' is a mount option (e.g. 'ro', for read-only mounts). See
                the Singularity for a description of the format and the
                supported options. Commas are not allowed in both the paths, and
                colons are not allowed in the 'src' path. GWMS combines in order
                GLIDEIN_SINGULARITY_BINDPATH,
                GLIDEIN_SINGULARITY_BINDPATH_DEFAULT, and a default list. The
                default list includes
                "/hadoop,/hdfs,/lizard,/mnt/hadoop,/mnt/hdfs", and "/cvmfs" (if
                GWMS_SINGULARITY_BIND_CVMFS is true) and some GPUs libraries (if
                GPUs are detected). If CVMFS is mounted in a different place,
                CVMFS_MOUNT_DIR will be set in the environment and the Glidein
                will replace /cvms with the correct mount point
                ($CVMFS_MOUNT_DIR:/cvmfs), so that inside Singularity CVMFS will
                always be available in /cvmfs, even if outside that is not
                possible. The combined list is validated removing paths not
                existing (outside Singularity) and is passed as --bind option to
                singularity. Singularity prepends to the mounts list also the
                environment variable $SINGULARITY_BINDPATH (this could be set by
                the Site or by setup scripts on the worker nodes). Singularity
                will skip mounts where the destination path does not exist in
                the Singularity image selected. The suggestion is to set
                GLIDEIN_SINGULARITY_BINDPATH_DEFAULT in the Factory and
                GLIDEIN_SINGULARITY_BINDPATH in the Frontend.

        <h2>Set and discover available CPUs</h2>
        <p>
          For this explanation the term CPUs refers to the number of cores,
          provided by one or more CPUs. It is whatever is detected or provided
          and will set the level of parallelism (NUM_CPUS) used by the HTCondor
          startd started by the Glidein.
        </p>
        <p>Jobs express the number of CPUs they require via RequestCpus.</p>
        <p>
          You can force HTCondor to assume it has a certain number of CPUs by
          setting GLIDEIN_CPUS to a number or let the Glidein discover the
          number of physical CPUs in the worker node (<tt>node</tt>) or the
          number of CPUs received from the job manager (<tt>slot</tt>,
          <tt>auto</tt>).
        </p>
        <p>
          If GLIDEIN_CPUS is set to <tt>auto</tt> (or <tt>slot</tt>,
          <tt>node</tt>). When the Frontend does provisioning, it triggers
          requests to resources where RequestCpus&lt;=GLIDEIN_ESTIMATED_CPUS (1
          if GLIDEIN_ESTIMATED_CPUS is not set) and it is dimensioning the
          request expecting to receive CPUs = GLIDEIN_ESTIMATED_CPUS *
          number_of_glidiens.
          <br />
          When Glideins actually start at the site, they advertise the CPUs they
          actually discover, ignoring what is set in GLIDEIN_ESTIMATED_CPUS and
          will match jobs with RequestCpus&lt;=CPUs discovered. This is
          different from setting GLIDEIN_CPUS, that artificially tells HTCondor
          in the Glidein that it has those CPUs, over- or under-provisioning if
          the number of CPUs discovered is different.
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you have a site with a variable number of CPUs you can set
          GLIDEIN_ESTIMATED_CPUS to the min number of CPUs you will be receiving
          (for ease call it MinCpus). All jobs triggering Glideins on that site
          will be able to run on them. Multiple jobs will run on the same
          Glidein if it receives more CPUs. If you need to run jobs w/
          RequestCpus&gt;MinCpus, you can set GLIDEIN_ESTIMATED_CPUS to a bigger
          number but be aware that some Glideins (the ones that received less
          than GLIDEIN_ESTIMATED_CPUS CPUs) will not match jobs that triggered
          their submission (those Glideins will probably be wasted).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another attribute changing the number of CPUs is
          GLIDEIN_Resource_Slots. When you add resource slots of type
          <tt>extra</tt>, <tt>partitionable</tt> or <tt>static</tt>, these
          increase the number of CPUs set in HTCondor, independently from
          whether the initial number was set with GLIDEIN_CPUS or discovered.
          These virtual CPUs are though not considered in provisioning, are
          frequently reserved for jobs matching the special resources
          (<tt>partitionable</tt>, <tt>static</tt>) and are available also for
          regular jobs only when the slot type <tt>extra</tt>

        <h2>Lifetime of a Glidein</h2>
        <img src="../images/retire_times.png" alt="Retire time plot" />
        <p>
          All the various variables in the glidein configuration can be
          confusing. The above diagram illustrates the lifetime of a glidein
          pilot that has a long-running job.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <font color="499946"><i>Green</i></font
            >: For the first GLIDEIN_Retire_Time seconds (modified by a random
            spread GLIDEIN_Retire_Spread to smooth out glideins all ending
            simultaneously), jobs can start on the glidein pilot.
          </li>
          <li>
            <font color="f8d844"><i>Yellow</i></font
            >: During the yellow period, START will evauluate to FALSE, so no
            new jobs will start. However, already running jobs will continue to
            run for GLIDEIN_Job_Max_Time. (Note that the glideins will end
            during this period if the job ends. They will not idle afterwards
            since no new jobs can start anyway).
          </li>
          <li>
            Once this period is done, the DAEMON_SHUTDOWN variable will be true.
          </li>
          <li>
            <font color="f8bb44"><i>Orange</i></font
            >: There can be a delay of up to UPDATE_INTERVAL (usually about 5
            minutes) between when DAEMON_SHUTDOWN becomes true and when it is
            actually updated in the collector. This is because the collector
            only reevaluates this expression periodically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <font color="c7484c"><i>Red</i></font
            >: Once DAEMON_SHUTDOWN is true, condor gives a short grace period
            of GLIDEIN_Graceful_Shutdown before forcefully terminating
            everything and shutting down. All of these periods are totalled and
            calculated to fit within GLIDEIN_MAX_WALLTIME if specified.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that if a job ends early in the green period, a new job will
          start. If a job ends after this period, then the glidein will shut
          down and end early. This can be seen in the example below with two
          jobs below:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/idle_times.jpg" alt="Idle time plot" />
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <font color="f8bb44"><i>Orange</i></font
            >: A glidein first starts up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <font color="f8d844"><i>Yellow</i></font
            >: After starting up, the glidein will wait for Glidein_Max_Idle for
            its initial matching. If it is Idle for longer than this, it will
            assume no jobs are available and will shutdown.
          </li>
          <li>
            <font color="499946"><i>Green</i></font
            >: A job runs (subject to the maximum limits in the previous
            diagram).
          </li>

          <li>
            <font color="f8d844"><i>Yellow</i></font
            >: Once a job runs, it will wait for Glidein_Max_Tail for another
            job.
          </li>
          <li>
            <font color="499946"><i>Green</i></font
            >: Another matching job runs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <font color="f8d844"><i>Yellow</i></font
            >: Once the job finishes, it will wait for Glidein_Max_Tail for
            another job. If cannot find one, it will shutdown.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Glidein_Max_Tail counts the idle time after the previous job ends, as
        specified above. N.B.: 12 hours after the walltime, a glidein is removed
        from the factory queue no matter what is using a periodic remove
        expression. This is done to prevent <i>staleness of glideins</i> which
        are the glideins that appears running in the factory condor queue
        indefinitely, but are no longer in the CE queue.

      <div class="section" id="draining">
        <h2>Draining glideins</h2>

        <p>
          In this section we describe the steps to follow to activate the
          feature that allows to drain glideins.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On the execute hosts, create a directory in which MACHINEFEATURES
            attributes will be set, say its name is <tt>/path/to/dir</tt>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the MACHINEFEATURES job environment variable to point to the
            directory. For example, you can use the following condor
            configuration parameter:
            <tt>STARTER_JOB_ENVIRONMENT = "MACHINEFEATURES=/path/to/dir"</tt>
          </li>
          <li>
            When a machine is draining, create a file named "shutdowntime" in
            the MJF directory. Put the draining deadline unix timestamp in the
            file. Even a distant time in the future is sufficient to cause the
            glidein to set SiteWMS_WN_Draining=True and stop accepting new jobs
            (this is controled by the <tt>check_wn_drainstate.sh</tt> condor
            CROND script).
          </li>
        </ul>
