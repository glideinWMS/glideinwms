        <h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview of the glidein mechanism</h2>
        <p>
          A glidein is, simply put, a properly configured
          <a
            href="https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-manual/introduction-admin-manual.html#the-htcondor-daemons"
            >HTCondor Startd</a
          >
          submitted as a Grid job. Once a glidein starts on a worker node, it
          will join a specified HTCondor pool, making the obtained Grid-batch
          slot a slot in the HTCondor pool. At this point, a regular HTCondor
          job can start there as if was a dedicated resource. See the picture
          below for a schematic overview.
        </p>
        <img src="../images/glideins.png" />
        <p>
          HTCondor glideins are a convenient way to expand a HTCondor pool.
          Apart from the task of submitting new glideins as needed, everything
          else stays the same as in a dedicated pool.
        </p>
        <p>
          In GlideinWMS, the <a href="index.html">Glidein Factory</a> is the one
          that submits the glideins to the Grid resources, as shown in the
          picture below.
        </p>

        <p><img src="../images/factory_overview.png" /></p>
        <p>
          This document describes how a glidein configures and starts the
          <a
            href="https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-manual/introduction-admin-manual.html#the-htcondor-daemons"
            >HTCondor Startd</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Glidein Factory sends just a wrapper. However, it must perform
          several tasks, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check that the working environment on the worker node is reasonable
            (else user jobs will fail)
          </li>
          <li>Obtain the HTCondor binaries</li>
          <li>Configure HTCondor</li>

          <li>Prepare the environment for HTCondor and the user jobs</li>
          <li>Start HTCondor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Given the complexity of the task, and for the sake of flexibility, it
          makes sense to split the script in several pieces. So the glidein job
          is composed of several pieces, including a startup script, helper
          scripts, the HTCondor binaries and a base configuration file.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, having a Grid job with data files can represent a challenge;
          each Grid flavor treats data in a different way. To make the system as
          general as possible, the glideins rely on HTTP for data distribution.
          However, since the HTTP protocol is not a secure one, the glidein
          implements its own security on top of it.
        </p>
        <p>The picture below for an overview.</p>
        <img src="../images/glidein_script.png" />
        <p>
          The security is implemented using SHA1 signatures. The signature
          checking is implemented in two steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The signatures of all the files to be transfered are saved in a
              signature file and stored on the Web server. The signature of the
              signature file is then passed as one of the parameters of the
              glidein job.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The glidein startup script loads the signature file from the Web
              server and verifies its signature. All other downloads, including
              the file containing the list of other files, is checked against
              the values in the signature file. See the pseudo-code below.
            </p>
            <pre>
wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/signature.sha1
sha1sum <i>known_sha1</i> signature.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 1
fi
grep files_name signature.sha1 &gt; file.sha1
wget http://head.fnal.gov/glidein_g1/files_anme
sha1sum -c file.sha1
if $?!=0 then
 exit 2
fi</pre
            >
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Assuming that the glidein arguments cannot be tampered with, all the
          files are tamper evident.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a file is marked as executable, it will be run. This allows to
          customize the glidein logic at will.<br />However, if not all files
          need to be executable; plain files, like configuration files, and
          tarballs are also supported.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section" id="flow">
        <h2>Program flow</h2>
        <p>
          The glidein startup script is tasked to setup the working environment,
          configure HTCondor and launch the
          <a
            href="https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-manual/introduction-admin-manual.html#the-htcondor-daemons"
            >HTCondor Startd</a
          >.<br />
          As said in the overview, a glidein is basically a wrapper that
          downloads other files, executing some of them. <br />A private working
          directory is used to minimize interference with other processes
          running on the same node.
        </p>
        <p>At the high level, three types of files are handled:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Signature files</li>
          <li>Files containing lists of other files</li>
          <li>
            Helper files; these can be either simple files, tarballs or
            executables.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The files are also split between general, or Factory wide, and
          entry-specific ones. Since order can be important, especially when
          executables are involved, the glidein allows for global helper files
          to be loaded (and executed) before and/or after the entry-specific
          ones. One executable is special; this is the helper script that starts
          the
          <a
            href="https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-manual/introduction-admin-manual.html#the-htcondor-daemons"
            >HTCondor Startd</a
          >. and must be the last to be run, so it is handled in a special way.
        </p>
        <p>See the picture below for an overview.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/flow_glidein_main.png" /></p>

        <p>
          You may have noticed that after the initial setup, all further
          communication between stages is carried out by a locally created
          config file. The reason for this is due to the fact that environment
          changes can only propagate in one direction, from parent to child.
          Since most of the setup is done by external executables that would be
          unacceptable, the config file was introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the stages are pretty self explanatory, but most need further
          details. In particular:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#flow_sign">Get signatures and file info</a></li>
          <li><a href="#flow_file">Download and process a file</a></li>
          <li><a href="#flow_condor">Configure and start HTCondor</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3><a name="flow_sign"></a>Get signatures and file info</h3>
        <p>
          The retrieval of the signature files is a multi step process. The main
          reason being that the startup script does not know the name of the
          signature file.<br />Instead, the glidein startup script receives the
          name of the file that contains the names of all the other important
          files. And that file is fetched first.<br />Once the name of the
          signature file is know, it is fetched and validated against the
          provided SHA1 signature.<br />Once the signature file can be trusted,
          the description file is verified, too, using the signature present in
          the signature file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the signature files are fetched, the content of the description
          files is loaded into memory for further processing.
        </p>
        <p>See the figure below of an overview.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/flow_glidein_sign.png" /></p>
        <p>
          You have probably noticed that the name of the signature file is
          extracted before validating the integrity of the description file.
          This can result in a compromised signature being fetched.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this is <b>not</b> a security vulnerability. If the wrong
          signature file is indeed downloaded, the signature of the signature
          will not match and the glidein will terminate with a failure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3><a name="flow_file"></a>Download and process a file</h3>
        <p>
          The glidein startup script will download and process several files.
          This stage will download one of these files.
        </p>
        <p>
          File downloading and processing can be conditional; if a conditional
          variable name is given and such conditional variable evaluates to
          False (0) in the configuration file, the stage is effectively a NOOP.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stage flow requires a fetch of a file over the network and the
          validation against the proper signature file. If for some reason the
          signature does not match, the glidein will terminate with a
          failure.<br />Some files need further processing; they are either
          tarballs that need to be unpacked, or executables that need to be run.
          This stage will take the appropriate action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the invoker of this stage may request for the file processing
          to be recorded in the configuration file, by providing an output
          variable name.
        </p>
        <p>See figure below for an overview.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/flow_glidein_file.png" /></p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3><a name="flow_condor"></a>Configure and start HTCondor</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned before, most of the work in a glidein is carried on by
          the
          <a
            href="https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-manual/introduction-admin-manual.html#the-htcondor-daemons"
            >HTCondor Startd</a
          >. This stage the condor_startd is configured and launched.<br />To do
          this, the script parses the HTCondor variable description files and
          extracts the needed values from the glidein configuration file. If no
          values is provided, the default is used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once all the variables are collected, the condor_config is created.<br />The
          script now launches two HTCondor startds, by means of a condor_master.
          The first one is a monitoring startd and is not managed.<br />The
          second one is instead the main, job startd, and the glidein code
          blocks on it. This startd will do the bulk of the processing,
          advertising itself to a collector and accepting user jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the main startd ends, the monitoring startd is killed and the log
          files parsed for job statistics that will be printed in standard
          output. For debugging purposes, the whole log files are then
          compressed and streamed to the standard error.

      <div class="section">
        <h2><a name="source"></a>Source code distribution</h2>
        <p>
          The glidein code is composed of a set of shell code scripts, mostly
          using <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/">bash</a>, although grep
          and <a href="http://www.vectorsite.net/tsawk.html">awk</a> are used
