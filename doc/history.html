        <ul>
	  <li>Add attr_dict in the environment of the frontend match_expr

          <li>The start_expr is now a native part of match
          <li>Startd now advertises per-slot memory when configured by the factory.  VO frontend can use GLIDEIN_MaxMemMBs_Estimate attr to make glidein estimate the available memory (based on memory/core or memory/cpu)
          <li>entry_q now reads GLIDEIN_FACTORY_DIR from env before checking cwd
          <li>Multiple user collectors are supported in HA mode
          <li>Factory can specify if glexec required vs provided by site
          <li>Providing config file locations for glideinwms.xml and frontend.xml is optional during reconfig
          <li>Entry downtime reason is now reported in the glidefactory classad
          <li>Improved support for RHEL 6 platform
          <li>Added support for new ARC Gatekeeper 1.x
          <li>Linux distro of the worker node is available in the glidein's classad
          <li>Condor classad fields are now considered case insensitive

          <li>Bug Fix: Glidein correctly handles semicolons in STARTER_JOB_ENVIRONMENT
          <li>Bug Fix: Java is correctly disable by default preventing increase in the image size during condor daemon benchmarking
          <li>Bug Fix: Frontend correctly correctly supports <attr> properties
          <li>Bug Fix: Glidein now correctly finds glexec on glite site
          <li>Bug Fix: Glideins update the user collector using TCP by default
          <li>Bug Fix: Ini-Installer now correctly works with condor tarball on RHEL6
          <li>Bug Fix: Reduced the logging in factory generated by inactive entries
          <li>Bug Fix: For frontend rpm, init.d scriptes now correctly sudo to the frontend user before reconfig

          <li>Bug Fix: It is possible to specify limits for different frontends for an entry in the factory config
          <li>Bug Fix: Glidein sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so condor uses local shared libraries before those in system path
          <li>KNOWN ISSUE: When the monitor work_dir is moved, reconfig/upgrade
          will fail. Recommended work-around is to delete the xml configuration           in the work directory, change the work directory, then
          reconfig/upgrade.
          <li>KNOWN ISSUE: If the work directory has changed, frontend startup
          upgrade will not create the group directories and then the frontend
          will fail (silently). If you are changing directories (e.g. from a RPM
          upgrade), you should copy the group directories manually.

	  populated with information from the configuration files (no scripts).
	  <li>The OSG rpm worker node client requires changes to glidein startup
	  scripts. If you plan on using OSG sites that have used this rpm, you
