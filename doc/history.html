          <li>Factory now supports glidein failure modes. This information is
          propagated back to the factory.
          <li>Glideins now have different idle timeouts for startup and tail.
          The glideins now exit much faster after comleting jobs and they do not
          have enough time left to run another job.
          <li>Added support for javascriptRRD 2.6.2
          <li>Consolidate the condor_tarball tag in glideinwms.xml to read in
          a list of os, arch, version. See docs for details.
          <li>Ini-installer will default collector_port to 9618 if not
          specified in appropriate config sections.
          <li>Installation now supports GRIDMANAGER_PROXY_REFRESH_TIME for
          condorg services
          <li>Improved logging when frontend fails to evaluate match expressions.
          <li>Monitoring pages changed to be even more compliant with DOM4
          <li>Improved the means for distributing condor config files for
          different condor services.
          <li>Improved documentation.
          <li>Bug Fix: Better handling of monitor dir during upgrade
          <li>Bug Fix: Factory correctlt handles frontend in downtime and now
          it does not affect requests from other frontends

          user
          <li>Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where v2.6.1 frontend would crash under
          certain
          <li>Bug Fix: Installers do not set CONDOR_VERSION as constant by
          default.  This will now enable frontends to override this attr.
          <li>Bug Fix: Ini-installer now correctly cleans up files on re-install

        <ul>
          <li>Factory now limits the speed at which it releases held glideins. After too many unrecoverable attempts, held glideins are removed.
          <li>Added support for Condor 7.8+<br>
          <b>KNOWN ISSUE:</b> Only applies if you upgrade condor binaries in place
          without using the installer. Upgrading condor binaries for user pool
          and the wms collector with multiple schedds should not be done without          corresponding changes to the condor configuration file. If the
          JOB_QUEUE_LOG is not correctly configured for each sched, condor
          queue will be corrupted for all the scheds
          <li>Glideins now support curl & data file transfer plugins in condor
          <li>New installations of factory and frontend services now communicate with
          condor daemons using TCP by default.
          <li>Bug Fix: Factory configuration now supports specifying limits for
          different security classes of same frontend<br>
          <b>KNOWN ISSUE:</b> If limits are configured in the factory, this change 
          breaks backward compatibility. As a workaround, admin needs to remove
          the limits and re-apply them after installation and initial configuration
          <li>Bug Fix: Factory monitoring pages now correctly work in Firefox 14+
          <li>Bug Fix: Frontend now monitors the glideins correctly when the
          corresponding factory classad is missing

          from a voms proxy

        <ul>
          <li>Add attr_dict in the environment of the frontend match_expr
          <li>Config defined attributes are now available in match_expr
          <li>Factory now supports deleting entries using --force_delete

          <li>Frontend advertises its monitoring url to the factory
          <li>Misbehaving glidein can be put on hold using WANT_HOLD
          <li>The start_expr is now a native part of match
          <li>Startd now advertises per-slot memory when configured by the factory.  VO frontend can use GLIDEIN_MaxMemMBs_Estimate attr to make glidein estimate the available memory (based on memory/core or memory/cpu)
          <li>entry_q now reads GLIDEIN_FACTORY_DIR from env before checking cwd
          <li>Multiple user collectors are supported in HA mode
          <li>Factory can specify if glexec required vs provided by site
          <li>Providing config file locations for glideinwms.xml and frontend.xml is optional during reconfig
          <li>Entry downtime reason is now reported in the glidefactory classad
          <li>Improved support for RHEL 6 platform
          <li>Added support for new ARC Gatekeeper 1.x
          <li>Linux distro of the worker node is available in the glidein's classad
          <li>Condor classad fields are now considered case insensitive

          <li>Bug Fix: Glidein correctly handles semicolons in STARTER_JOB_ENVIRONMENT
          <li>Bug Fix: Java is correctly disable by default preventing increase in the image size during condor daemon benchmarking

          <li>Bug Fix: It is possible to specify limits for different frontends for an entry in the factory config
          <li>Bug Fix: Glidein sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so condor uses local shared libraries before those in system path
          <li>KNOWN ISSUE: When the monitor work_dir is moved, reconfig/upgrade
          will fail. Recommended work-around is to delete the xml configuration           in the work directory, change the work directory, then
          reconfig/upgrade.
          <li>KNOWN ISSUE: If the work directory has changed, frontend startup
          upgrade will not create the group directories and then the frontend
          will fail (silently). If you are changing directories (e.g. from a RPM
          upgrade), you should copy the group directories manually.

          the frontend startup script. 'reconfig' only updates the files
          populated with information from the configuration files (no scripts).
          <li>The OSG rpm worker node client requires changes to glidein startup
          scripts. If you plan on using OSG sites that have used this rpm, you
          must "upgrade" your factory in order to get glideins.
