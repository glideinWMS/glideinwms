v3_9_6:
  Date: October 27, 2022
  Series: Development
  Tarball: false
  Feature:
    - Added token authentication to Glideins running in the Cloud (AWS and GCE). Now Glideins on all supported resources can authenticate back using IDTOKENS when using recent HTCSS versions.
    - Added `GLIDEIN_PERIODIC_SCRIPT` env variable to notify periodic custom scripts
    - Added the possibility to set the Glidein HTCSS TRUST_DOMAIN as attribute in the Frontend configuration
    - The Frontend configuration is now valid (reconfig/upgrade successful) even if some HTCSS schedds are not in DNS. Failing only if all schedds are unknown to DNS
  Bug fix:
    - Fixed `glidien_config` corrupted by concurrent custom scripts run via HTCSS startd cron (#163)
    - Fixed `setup_x509.sh` not to write to stdout when running as periodic script in HTCSS start cron (issues#162,#164)
    - Fixed setup_x509.sh creates proxy file in directory used for tokens (issue#201)
    - Fixed GLIDEIN_START_DIR_ORIG and GLIDEIN_WORKSPACE_ORIG values in glidein_config
    - Fixed unnecessary proxy/hostcert.pem workaround in frontend config (issue#66)
    - Fixed analyze_entries and python3 readiness (issue#194)
    - Fixed gwms-renew-proxies service should check if local VOMS cert is expired (issue#21)
    - Fixed python3 check return value in case of exception (PR#211)
    - Fixed list_get_intersection in singularity_lib.sh that was requiring python2 (PR#212)
    - Unset SEC_PASSWORD_DIRECTORY in the Glidein HTCSS configuration, was causing warnings for unknown files (PR#226)
    - HTCSS DC_DAEMON_LIST now is equal to DAEMON_LIST only in the Factory, in all other GlideinWMS components only selected HTCSS daemons are added explicitly to it (issue#205)
    - Working and local tmp directories are removed during Glidein cleanup also when the start directory is missing. This result in a loss of Glidein final status information but avoids sandbox leaks on the Worker Node. (issue#189)
  NOTE:
    - custom scripts should always read values via gconfig_get(). The only exception is
      the parsing or the line to get the add_config_line source file
    - add_config_line is deprecated in favor of gconfig_add. Will be removed from future versions
    - add_config_line_safe is deprecated in favor of gconfig_add_safe. gconfig_add is the recommended method to use also in concurrent scripts
    - gconfig_add_unsafe, with a similar behavior to the former add_config_line, has been added. Its use is not recommended, unless absolutely sure that no script will be run in parallel
    - Only the first collector in TRUST_DOMAIN is kept, following collectors are removed. This happens both in the Frontend token issuer and in the setting of the Glidein TRUST_DOMAIN (setup_x509.sh).

    - Have `get_prop_str` return the default value when the attribute is "undefined" and `gwms_from_config` return the default when set instead of an empty string (PR#235)
    - Fixed credential ID in Glideins. It was not set for scitokens causing incorrect monitoring values (PR#242)
    - Fixed typo in `singularity_lib.sh` (issue#249)

  NOTE:
    - When using on-demand CVMFS, all Glideins after the first one on a node are failing (issue#287)
  NOTE-FACTORY:
    - The rebuilding of cvmfsexec distributions is now disabled by default, it must be enabled via the new factory knob.\
      If you are upgrading from v3.9.5 or later, check that the cvmfsexec script is no more in the pre-reconfigure hooks directory.

v3_10_3:
  Date: September 11, 2023
  Series: Stable
  Tarball: false
  Feature:
    - Added support for Debian 11 and Ubuntu 22 worker nodes (PR#320)
    - Added structured logging. It is a hybrid format with some fields followed by a JSON dictionary. The exact format of the messages may change in the future, and we plan for it to become the default. Now it is disabled by default. Add `structured="True"` to all `process_log` elements (PR#333)
    - Add option to set xml output directory in OSG_autoconf (PR#319)
    - Allow OSG_autoconf to skip sites or CEs that are not present in the OSG collector (PR#315)
    - Add option to set num_factories in OSG_autoconf (Issue#344, PR#345)
    - Added the ability to clear a list of variables from the environment via GLIDEIN_CONTAINER_ENV_CLEARLIST before starting a container (Issue#341, PR#342)
  Bug fix:
    - Removed `classad` from requirements.txt. The HTCSS team distributes only the `htcondor` library in PyPI which includes a different version of classad (PR#301)
    - Fixing Python 3.9 deprecations (`imp`, `getchildren()` in `xml.etree.ElementTree`) (PR#302, PR#303)
    - Populate missing Entry parameters for ARC CEs submissions (PR#304)
    - Modified the usage of subprocess module, for building/rebuilding cvmfsexec distributions, only when necessary (PR#309)
    - manual_glidein_submit now correctly sets idtokens in the EncryptedInputFiles (issue#283, PR#284)
    - Fixed fetch_rrd crash in EL9 causing missing monitoring and glidefactoryclient classad information (Issue#338, PR#339)
  NOTE-FACTORY:
    - When generating cvmfsexec distribution for EL9 machine type on an EL7 machine, the factory reconfig and/or upgrade fails as a result of an error in `create_cvmfsexec_distros.sh`. This is possibly due to the tools for EL7 being unable to handle EL9 files (as per Dave Dykstra). Please exercise caution if using `rhel9-x86_64` in the `mtypes` list for the `cvmfsexec_distro` tag in factory configuration.
      - Our workaround is to remove the EL9 machine type from the default list of machine types supported by the custom distros creation script.  Add it back if you are running on an EL9 system and want an EL9 cvmfsexec distrinution. (PR#312)'

  NOTE-FACTORY:
    - The submit attributes (submit/submit_attrs) are now published in the glidefactory classad with the GlideinSubmit prefix followed by the attribute name and same value. If the attribute name starts with "+" this will be replaced by "_PLUS_", since only alphanumeric characters and "_" are valid in ClassAd attribute names.

    - Fixed Apptainer validation not considering uid_map w/o initial blank (Issue#395, PR#396)
    - Flattening error message in \_CONDOR_WRAPPER_ERROR_FILE and JobWrapperFailure Ad. This is a workaround for a bug in HTCondor (PR#400)

    - Allow anonymous SSL authentication for the dynamically generated client config (Issue#222, PR#470)
    - Checking also the apptainer binary in the SINGULARITY_BIN path, not only singularity (PR#473)
  NOTE:
    - The Glidein will always send SIGQUIT to HTCondor when it receives INT, TERM, QUIT signals. This speeds up the shutdown (PR#466)
    - Renamed Glidein Logging functions to glog_... (glog_init, glog_setup, glog_write, glog_send - PR#467).
      The original functions (log_init_tokens, log_init, log_setup, log_write, send_logs_to_remote, ...) are no more available
    - Apptainer downloaded in the HTCondor tar ball is now considered after the PATH in the search for a valid binary.
      The keyword CONDOR in the parameter SINGULARITY_BIN will make so that the HTCondor Apptainer is preferred
      ahead of the rest (PR#473)
    - Added RHEL9 to the list of default OSes used for the container images lookup. Now it is default,rhel9,rhel7,rhel6,rhel8 (PR#473)

  Bug fix:
    - Protect processing of custom scripts in glidein_startup.sh against stdin interference (PR#498, Issue#500)
    - Some config files used in the RPM package, including the httpd ones, were obsolete and not the version in the source tree. (PR#492, PR#502)
    - Host IP is now searched in blacklist also when the host command is missing (PR#499, Issue#493)
    - Added missing HTCondor requirements in spec file (PR#502)
    - Unset CONDOR_INHERIT before condor startup to avoid any conflict in the condor configurations (PR#503, Issue#274)

  NOTE-FRONTEND:
    - The default Frontend tokens key is now variable, $HOME/passwords.d/UPPERCASE_USERNAME. There is no actual change since this is /var/lib/gwms-frontend/passwords.d/FRONTEND for normal RPM installations. (PR#504)
  NOTE-FACTORY:
    - The new variable SINGULARITY_IMAGE_REQUIRED defaults to false and allows to use Singularity/Apptainer also when the configured image is not available.
      The image must be provided by the job or a future custom script in order not to fail. (PR#482)
    - APPTAINER_TEST_IMAGE can be set to an always available Singularity/Apptainer image to use for testing.
      Defaults to oras://ghcr.io/apptainer/alpine:latest (PR#482)

    - Added support for Ubuntu 24 workers (PR#529)
    - Add keyword ALL to query all schedulers known to the collector without listing them explicitly (Issue#510, PR#532)
    - Updated download/execution order of `cvmfs_setup.sh` during glidein startup using a new priority `precvmfs_file_list` (PR#528)
    - Add keyword usertrace to the GLIDEIN_DEBUG_OPTIONS custom variable to enable shell tracing in user jobs and wrapper (PR#540)
    - Glideins can start containers with Busybox and no Bash, e.g Alpine Linux. The Glidein itself still requires Bash (Issue#538, PR#540)
  Bug fix:
    - Removed incorrect warning when setting SINGULARITY_BIN to keyword (PR#534)
    - Added `--skip-broken` to yumalldeps to avoid an error when incompatible packages are in the list (Issue#530, PR#534)

    - Added workaround for HTCondor setting PATH only as variable and not in the environment (PR#539)
  NOTE:
    - In the Glidein, `cvmfs_setup.sh` is now executing earlier, right after entry scripts (PR#528)
    - Removed compatibility with GWMS<3.4.5. GlideinWMS v3.4.6 up to v3.10.14 Factories and Frontend are interoperable.

v3_10_15:

    - Added ramp_up_attenuation config parameter to control Glidein provisioning remap-up (PR#556)
    - Updates the pilot generation logic in OSG_autoconf to check the OSG_BatchSystem attribute from the OSG collector. If the batch system is set to "CONDOR", the resulting pilot entry will have work_dir set to "Condor" (PR#558)
    - Updates the pilot generation logic in OSG_autoconf to use the cpus attribute from the OSG collector to set GLIDEIN_ESTIMATED_CPUs (PR#560)
  Bug fix:
    - Retrieve and use CVMFS_MOUNT_DIR from glidein_config if not in the environment (PR#552)
    - Addressed POSIX mode problems and CVMFS path resolution (PR#555)
  NOTE:
    - The job wrappers in the Glidein are now running with the `/bin/sh` prompt instead of `/bin/bash`. They use Bash and `set +o posix` when possible, but there may be another shell.
    - Duplicate repositories in the GLIDEIN_CVMFS_REPOS list will fail cvmfsexec.

v3_10_16:
  Date: September 29, 2025
  Series: Stable

  Feature:
    - create_cvmfsexec_distros.sh updated adding EL9 to platforms and improved command syntax (Issue#549, PR#582)
    - Added new staticextra resource type – behaves like static (creates one dedicated slot per instance with a virtual CPU each), but instead of subtracting memory from the main partitionable slot, it adds memory to it (Issue#590, PR#591)
    - "OSG_autoconf: Added mapping for EIC and CLAS12 and support for the new dedicated `OSG` collector parameter to set `EstimatedCPUs` replacing the use of the generic `CPUs` (PR#595)"
  Bug fix:
    - Fixed incorrect glog_get_logfile_path_relative call in condor_startup.sh (PR#579)
    - Fixed Frontend reconfiguration failure when using "ALL" schedd (Issue#575, PR#580)

    - Fixed wrong exec command in wrapper script (Issue#584, PR#587)
    - Environment cleanup fixed. `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, and `LD_PRELOAD` are now correctly cleared when requested with `clearpaths` or `clearall` (Issue#592, PR#596)
    - Fixed maxWallTime not being set as a submit attribute by OSG_autoconf when an entry is whole node (PR#595)
  NOTE:
    - Added httpd configuration to enhance security by disabling version headers and trace (PR#578)
    - Since 3.10.15, all job wrapper scripts must be "POSIX" compatible to be able to run on small images with Busybox. Added a relaxation in 3.10.16, setting `set +o posix` when Bash is available (PR#587)
