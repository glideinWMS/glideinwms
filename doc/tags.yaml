v3_6:
  Date: September 25, 2019
  Series: Stable
  Tarball: true
  Feature:
    - Renaming of v3_5_1 (released on 9/18) to respect the odd/even numbering

  Bug fix:
    - pip errors in nightly CI
    - Unittest failing at times on SL7
    - Factory could start also w/ a GT2 entry enabled
  NOTE:
    - v3_6 is fully interoperable w/ v3_5 and v3_4. I.e. You can mix v3_6_x, v3_5_x and v3_4_x Factories and Frontends in your system
  NOTE-FACTORY:
    - The v3.6 Factory (like v3.5) is using a single user. This is a major change. If you are upgrading, after the RPM upgrade you will need to:\
      1. stop Factory and HTCondor, 2. Migrate the HTCondor status running the fact_chown script, 3. Run upgrade and restart the HTCondor and the Factory.

v3_9_6:
  Date: October 27, 2022
  Series: Development
  Tarball: false
  Feature:
    - Added `GLIDEIN_PERIODIC_SCRIPT` env variable to notify periodic custom scripts
    - Added the possibility to set the Glidein HTCSS TRUST_DOMAIN as attribute in the Frontend configuration
    - The Frontend configuration is now valid (reconfig/upgrade successful) even if some HTCSS schedds are not in DNS. Failing only if all schedds are unknown to DNS
  Bug fix:
    - Fixed `glidien_config` corrupted by concurrent custom scripts run via HTCSS startd cron (#163)
    - Fixed `setup_x509.sh` not to write to stdout when running as periodic script in HTCSS start cron (issues #162, #164 )
    - Fixed setup_x509.sh creates proxy file in directory used for tokens (issue #201)
    - Fixed GLIDEIN_START_DIR_ORIG and GLIDEIN_WORKSPACE_ORIG values in glidein_config
    - Fixed unnecessary proxy/hostcert.pem workaround in frontend config (issue #66)
    - Fixed analyze_entries and python3 readiness (issue #194)
    - Fixed gwms-renew-proxies service should check if local VOMS cert is expired (issue #21)
    - Fixed python3 check return value in case of exception (PR #211)
    - Fixed list_get_intersection in singularity_lib.sh that was requiring python2 (PR #212)
    - Unset SEC_PASSWORD_DIRECTORY in the Glidein HTCSS configuration, was causing warnings for unknown files (PR #226)
    - HTCSS DC_DAEMON_LIST now is equal to DAEMON_LIST only in the Factory, in all other GlideinWMS components only selected HTCSS daemons are added explicitly to it (issue #205)
    - Working and local tmp directories are removed during Glidein cleanup also when the start directory is missing. This result in a loss of Glidein final status information but avoids sandbox leaks on the Worker Node. (issue #189)
  NOTE:
    - custom scripts should always read values via gconfig_get(). The only exception is
      the parsing or the line to get the add_config_line source file
    - add_config_line is deprecated in favor of gconfig_add. Will be removed from future versions
    - add_config_line_safe is deprecated in favor of gconfig_add_safe. gconfig_add is the recommended method to use also in concurrent scripts
    - gconfig_add_unsafe, with a similar behavior to the former add_config_line, has been added. Its use is not recommended, unless absolutely sure that no script will be run in parallel
    - Only the first collector in TRUST_DOMAIN is kept, following collectors are removed. This happens both in the Frontend token issuer and in the setting of the Glidein TRUST_DOMAIN (setup_x509.sh).
