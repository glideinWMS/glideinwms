  Tarball: true
  Feature:
    - Renaming of v3_5_1 (released on 9/18) to respect the odd/even numbering

    - Factory could start also w/ a GT2 entry enabled
  NOTE:
    - v3_6 is fully interoperable w/ v3_5 and v3_4. I.e. You can mix v3_6_x, v3_5_x and v3_4_x Factories and Frontends in your system
  NOTE-FACTORY:
    - The v3.6 Factory (like v3.5) is using a single user. This is a major change. If you are upgrading, after the RPM upgrade you will need to:\
      1. stop Factory and HTCondor, 2. Migrate the HTCondor status running the fact_chown script, 3. Run upgrade and restart the HTCondor and the Factory.
