  NOTE-FACTORY:
    - The v3.6 Factory (like v3.5) is using a single user. This is a major change. If you are upgrading, after the RPM upgrade you will need to:\
      1. stop Factory and HTCondor, 2. Migrate the HTCondor status running the fact_chown script, 3. Run upgrade and restart the HTCondor and the Factory.

v3_9_6:
  Date: October 27, 2022
  Series: Development
  Tarball: false
  Feature:
    - Added token authentication to Glideins running in the Cloud (AWS and GCE). Now Glideins on all supported resources can authenticate back using IDTOKENS when using recent HTCSS versions.
    - Added `GLIDEIN_PERIODIC_SCRIPT` env variable to notify periodic custom scripts
    - Added the possibility to set the Glidein HTCSS TRUST_DOMAIN as attribute in the Frontend configuration
    - The Frontend configuration is now valid (reconfig/upgrade successful) even if some HTCSS schedds are not in DNS. Failing only if all schedds are unknown to DNS
  Bug fix:
    - Fixed `glidien_config` corrupted by concurrent custom scripts run via HTCSS startd cron (#163)
    - Fixed `setup_x509.sh` not to write to stdout when running as periodic script in HTCSS start cron (issues#162,#164)
    - Fixed setup_x509.sh creates proxy file in directory used for tokens (issue#201)
    - Fixed GLIDEIN_START_DIR_ORIG and GLIDEIN_WORKSPACE_ORIG values in glidein_config
    - Fixed unnecessary proxy/hostcert.pem workaround in frontend config (issue#66)
    - Fixed analyze_entries and python3 readiness (issue#194)
    - Fixed gwms-renew-proxies service should check if local VOMS cert is expired (issue#21)
    - Fixed python3 check return value in case of exception (PR#211)
    - Fixed list_get_intersection in singularity_lib.sh that was requiring python2 (PR#212)
    - Unset SEC_PASSWORD_DIRECTORY in the Glidein HTCSS configuration, was causing warnings for unknown files (PR#226)
    - HTCSS DC_DAEMON_LIST now is equal to DAEMON_LIST only in the Factory, in all other GlideinWMS components only selected HTCSS daemons are added explicitly to it (issue#205)
    - Working and local tmp directories are removed during Glidein cleanup also when the start directory is missing. This result in a loss of Glidein final status information but avoids sandbox leaks on the Worker Node. (issue#189)
  NOTE:
    - custom scripts should always read values via gconfig_get(). The only exception is
      the parsing or the line to get the add_config_line source file
    - add_config_line is deprecated in favor of gconfig_add. Will be removed from future versions
    - add_config_line_safe is deprecated in favor of gconfig_add_safe. gconfig_add is the recommended method to use also in concurrent scripts
    - gconfig_add_unsafe, with a similar behavior to the former add_config_line, has been added. Its use is not recommended, unless absolutely sure that no script will be run in parallel
    - Only the first collector in TRUST_DOMAIN is kept, following collectors are removed. This happens both in the Frontend token issuer and in the setting of the Glidein TRUST_DOMAIN (setup_x509.sh).

    - Have `get_prop_str` return the default value when the attribute is "undefined" and `gwms_from_config` return the default when set instead of an empty string (PR#235)
    - Fixed credential ID in Glideins. It was not set for scitokens causing incorrect monitoring values (PR#242)
    - Fixed typo in `singularity_lib.sh` (issue#249)

    - Protect OSG_autoconf from OSG collector unavailability (PR#276)
    - Fixed jobs going in unknown state in factory monitoring. added QUEUING state for new ARC-CEs REST (PR#286)
  NOTE:
    - When using on-demand CVMFS, all Glideins after the first one on a node are failing (issue#287)
  NOTE-FACTORY:
    - The rebuilding of cvmfsexec distributions is now disabled by default, it must be enabled via the new factory knob.\
      If you are upgrading from v3.9.5 or later, check that the cvmfsexec script is no more in the pre-reconfigure hooks directory.

v3_10_3:
  Date: September 11, 2023
  Series: Stable
  Tarball: false
  Feature:
    - Added support for Debian 11 and Ubuntu 22 worker nodes (PR#320)
    - Added structured logging. It is a hybrid format with some fields followed by a JSON dictionary. The exact format of the messages may change in the future, and we plan for it to become the default. Now it is disabled by default. Add `structured="True"` to all `process_log` elements (PR#333)
    - Add option to set xml output directory in OSG_autoconf (PR#319)
    - Allow OSG_autoconf to skip sites or CEs that are not present in the OSG collector (PR#315)
    - Add option to set num_factories in OSG_autoconf (Issue#344, PR#345)
    - Added the ability to clear a list of variables from the environment via GLIDEIN_CONTAINER_ENV_CLEARLIST before starting a container (Issue#341, PR#342)
  Bug fix:
    - Removed `classad` from requirements.txt. The HTCSS team distributes only the `htcondor` library in PyPI which includes a different version of classad (PR#301)
    - Fixing Python 3.9 deprecations (`imp`, `getchildren()` in `xml.etree.ElementTree`) (PR#302, PR#303)
    - Populate missing Entry parameters for ARC CEs submissions (PR#304)
    - Modified the usage of subprocess module, for building/rebuilding cvmfsexec distributions, only when necessary (PR#309)
    - manual_glidein_submit now correctly sets idtokens in the EncryptedInputFiles (issue#283, PR#284)
    - Fixed fetch_rrd crash in EL9 causing missing monitoring and glidefactoryclient classad information (Issue#338, PR#339)
  NOTE-FACTORY:
    - When generating cvmfsexec distribution for EL9 machine type on an EL7 machine, the factory reconfig and/or upgrade fails as a result of an error in `create_cvmfsexec_distros.sh`. This is possibly due to the tools for EL7 being unable to handle EL9 files (as per Dave Dykstra). Please exercise caution if using `rhel9-x86_64` in the `mtypes` list for the `cvmfsexec_distro` tag in factory configuration.
      - Our workaround is to remove the EL9 machine type from the default list of machine types supported by the custom distros creation script.  Add it back if you are running on an EL9 system and want an EL9 cvmfsexec distrinution. (PR#312)'

  NOTE-FACTORY:
    - The submit attributes (submit/submit_attrs) are now published in the glidefactory classad with the GlideinSubmit prefix followed by the attribute name and same value. If the attribute name starts with "+" this will be replaced by "_PLUS_", since only alphanumeric characters and "_" are valid in ClassAd attribute names.

v3_10_7:
  Date: January 16, 2024

  Tarball: false
  Feature:
    - Apptainer cache and temporary directory set in the Glidein working directory (Issue#403, PR#404)

    - Blackhole Detection. Stop accepting jobs if they are consumed at a rate higher than the configured limit and declare the Glidein a blackhole (Issue#331, PR#399)
  Bug fix:
    - Fixed Apptainer validation not considering uid_map w/o initial blank (Issue#395, PR#396)
    - Flattening error message in \_CONDOR_WRAPPER_ERROR_FILE and JobWrapperFailure Ad. This is a workaround for a bug in HTCondor (PR#400)
    - Fixed problem when check_signature in glidein_startup is not defined (PR#402)
    - get_tarballs look for HTCondor releases also in the update directory (Issue#412, PR#413)
