v2_7    glideinwms code is now organized as python packages
        Factory no longer creates long running process per entry. Instead, it
          runs only a single long running glideFactoryEntryGroup process
          instead of multiple glideFactoryEntry processes. Factory config
          supports two additional config attributes entry_parallel_workers
          and update_thread_count (see factory configuration docs for details)
        Improved factory prerformance by migrating popen calls to use python's
          subprocess library

v2_6_2  Factory now supports glidein failure modes. This information is
          propagated back to the factory.
        Glideins now have different idle timeouts for startup and tail. The
          glideins now exit much faster after comleting jobs and they do not
          have enough time left to run another job.
        Added support for javascriptRRD 2.6.2
        Consolidate the condor_tarball tag in glideinwms.xml to read in a list

        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where v2.6.1 frontend would crash under certain
        Bug Fix: Installers do not set CONDOR_VERSION as constant by default.
          This will now enable frontends to override this attr.
        Bug Fix: Ini-installer now correctly cleans up files on re-install

v2_6_1  Factory now limits the speed at which it releases held glideins. After 
          too many unrecoverable attempts, held glideins are removed.
        Added support for Condor 7.8+
          KNOWN ISSUE: Only applies if you upgrade condor binaries in place
          without using the installer. Upgrading condor binaries for user pool
          and the wms collector with multiple schedds should not be done without
          corresponding changes to the condor configuration file. If the
          JOB_QUEUE_LOG is not correctly configured for each sched, condor
          queue will be corrupted for all the scheds
        Glideins now support curl & data file transfer plugins in condor
        New installations of factory and frontend services now communicate with
          condor daemons using TCP by default.
        Bug Fix: Factory configuration now supports specifying limits for 
          different security classes of same frontend
          KNOWN ISSUE: If limits are configured in the factory, this change
          breaks backward compatibility. As a workaround, admin needs to remove
          the limits and re-apply them.
        Bug Fix: Factory monitoring pages now correctly work in Firefox 14+
        Bug Fix: Frontend now monitors the glideins correctly when the 
          corresponding factory classad is missing
        Bug Fix: Fixed factory logging. Factory can now correctly extract info
          from a voms proxy

        Frontend advertises its monitoring url to the factory
        Misbehaving glidein can be put on hold using WANT_HOLD
        The start_expr is now a native part of match
        Startd now advertises per-slot memory when configured by the factory.
          VO frontend can use GLIDEIN_MaxMemMBs_Estimate attr to make glidein 
          estimate the available memory (based on memory/core or memory/cpu)
        entry_q now reads GLIDEIN_FACTORY_DIR from env before checking cwd
        Multiple user collectors are supported in HA mode
        Factory can specify if glexec required vs provided by site
        Providing config file locations for glideinwms.xml and frontend.xml is
          optional during reconfig
        Entry downtime reason is now reported in the glidefactory classad
        Improved support for RHEL 6 platform

          changes the proxy used
        Bug Fix: It is possible to specify limits for different frontends for
          an entry in the factory config
        Bug Fix: Glidein sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so condor uses local shared
          libraries before those in system path
        KNOWN ISSUE: When the monitor work_dir is moved, reconfig/upgrade will
          fail. Recommended work-around is to delete the xml configuration in
          the work directory, change the work directory, then reconfig/upgrade.
        KNOWN ISSUE: If the work directory has changed, frontend startup
          upgrade will not create the group directories and then the frontend
          will fail (silently). If you are changing directories (e.g. from a RPM
          upgrade), you should copy the group directories manually.


v2_5_7
	Patch of the clean_glidein_queue to return 1 only when something was
	  really done

        Add autocomplete/search to table in frontendGroupGraphStatusNow.html
        Added 'upgrade' option to factory startup script so that all the
          files in the glidein submit directory are updated.  Did the same for
          the frontend startup script. 'reconfig' only updates the files
          populated with information from the configuration files (no scripts).
        The OSG rpm worker node client requires changes to glidein startup
          scripts. If you plan on using OSG sites that have used this rpm, you
          must "upgrade" your factory in order to get glideins.

          the schedd fails
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug in condor log parsing when we encounter event 400
          (Job was evicted)
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where factory would not correctly accept requests
          from frontends that were still using old keys

        Bug Fix: Revert the glidein shutdown behavior introduced in v2_5_2
        Bug Fix: Add condor_glexec_update_proxy to Condor tarball if available

v2_5_2  Frontend publishes glideresource classad to the pool collector. This

        BUG FIX: Fixed a bug introduced in v2_5 release where reconfiguring the
          factory would fail because of monitoring groups
        BUG FIX: Fixed a typo in one of the links in frontendRRDBrowse.html

v2_5	Installer can now install gridFTP and VOMS certs needed by CREAM
	glideinWMS release is now available in 3 different tarballs, frontend
	  only, factory only and a complete tarball.
	glideinWMS factory and the Corral frontend can now talk to each other
	Factory is smarter about handling held glideins
	Factory can now black/white list VOs on a per-entry basis
	Version of glideinWMS is now published in the classads. Scheme can 
	  detect any changes to any service appropriate files and advertises 
	  cersion as patched.
	Frontend should try to recover the crashed group before it gives up and
	  shutsdown
	Improvements to the monitoring
        Improvements to documentaion
	Add support for use of TCP in condor_advertise
	Add support for condor_advertise -multiple (requires Condor v7.5.4+)
	Improved factory stopping procedure
	Add XML monitoring files of RRD files on both factory and frontend
	Add JobsRunningHere attribute - CANNOT SIMPLY UPGRADE, NEEDS NEW
	  INSTANCE FOR BOTH FACTORY AND FRONTEND
	Graceful shutdown of the glidein by trapping signals in glidein_startup
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where factory would create a malformed 
	  glideinWMS.xml config file when configured to use a default proxy 
	  for glideins from the factory.
	BUG FIX: Factory entry sometimes stops reporting when it gets an 
	  exception for any reason
	BUG FIX: Top-level schedd_status.xml malformed Total data
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where the LogCounts.rrd was created with wrong
	  data types.
	KNOWN ISSUE: Automatic release of held glideins for CREAM CEs with 
	  issues could result in factory submitting more than required
	  glideins to the CE. As a workaround, disable release of held glideins
	  for CREAM CE.

v2_4_3  Install VOMS Certificates during the install time
	Entry does not print stacktrace when it fails to submit glidein.
	  Instead it logs the error message appropriately.
	Default scripts run on the worker node correctly print errors to
	  stderr instead of stdout
	Allow factory to startup from any directory
	Python scripts get the python from /usr/bin/env python instead of
	  /bin/env python making them more portable accross different linux
	  distros
	Better exception handling and error reporting
	Fixed how voms_proxy_init is looked for after VDT install
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where Summarize.listStored() in CondorMonitor.py
	  returned the wrong value
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug in factory monitoring that prevented proper
	  aggregation of sites
	BUG FIX: Correctly interpret DN from a voms proxy generated from a
	  service certificate.
	BUG FIX: Generate frontend's condor_config without empty values for
	  certain configuration options. Empty values is not the right way to
	  reset the configuration options.


v2_4_2	Fixed the incompatibility introduced in v2_4_1 in monitoring components.

v2_4_1	Add a new configuration option for PREEMPT_GRACE_TIME
	Move configuration of GLIDEIN_Job_Max_Time from the factory to the
	  frontend
	In factory config added checks to make sure Factory configuration is
	  consistent w.r.t CONDOR_ARCH, CONDOR_VERSION, CONDOR_OS
	Monitoring enhancement to make selection/deselection of groups/entries
	  easier
	Support GLIDEIN_Glexec_Use in frontend config attrs. Frontend can
	  mandate or make the use of GLEXEC optional. Used in conjunction with
	  GLEXEC_BIN in factory config. If GLEXEC_BIN in set to NONE for an
	  entry in factory config, it is assumed that the entry doesn't have
	  GLEXEC configured on site.
	Improvements to documentation
	BUG FIX: Allow the use of the same DN for both the security and the
	  collector
	BUG FIX: Returning invalid variable during proxy creation
	KNOWN ISSUES: Running glideinWMS v2_4_1 with Condor 7.5.3 has not been
	  tested. Altough, most of the things may work, security changes in
	  Condor may affect your installation.


v2_4	Add proxy security classes to the frontend
	Add SecurityName to the frontend.
	Add DNs for frontend proxy and all the daemons the frontend talks to;

	Implement privilege separation in the factory.
	Various minor refactoring of code to achieve the above.
	Aggregate gatekeeper/sites for factory monitoring. 
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct 
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not 
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

v2_3_2	Fixed a security bug in the way certificate/proxy DN(s) are handled. If
	  you are upgrading the installation rather than full install, you
	  should patch the condor_mapfile used by Condor daemons in your
	  installation using the convert_condormap tool available from the
	  glideinWMS download page. For additional security, users should
	  add new DN to the condor_mapfile only by using the glidecondor_addDN 
	  tool available in the glideinWMS/install directory.

v2_3_1	Updated documentation. This is document change only release
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct 
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not 
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

v2_3	Attempt to restart a crashed entry few times before shutting down the
	  factory. Restarting is allowed for max restart_attempts in time
	  interval restart_interval sec in te factory.

        Fixed a security bug in key handling. BREAKES BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY! But it is needed.
	Fixed a bug in glidein_startup.sh that prevented the passing of * as a parameter value
	Fixed a logical bug in the glidein config that resulted in job preemption.
	Added support for condor_ssh (v7.4 and up)
	Add support for unquoted string to be published in classads. The type is 'expr'
	Documentation Changes
	Minor bugs fixed.
 	KNOWN ISSUES: If using condor 7.4.0-7.4.2 and 7.5.0, USE_VOMS_ATTRIBUTESshould be set to false for Collector and negotiator to avoid potential problems and memory leaks in GSI libraries.

v2_2	Bug Fix: GLEXEC_JOB and GLEXEC_STARTER were not published in glideins
          classds. This was preventing psuedo interactive monitoring to work
          in case of GLEXEC.
	Made VDT optional.
	Addedd support for VDT 2.0, and made it the default.
	  Added Globus-Client and Myproxy-Client in the minimal VDT install.

	Added support for multiple versions of condor in a single factory.
	Added ReqEncIdentity to the frontend->factory protocol 
	   to prevent replay attacks.
	   WARNING: This effectively prevents old-style frontends to talk
                    to new style factories.
	   NOTE: Will only work with Condor 7.3.1 or newer
	KNOWN ISSUES: Pseudo interactive monitoring will not work with glexec.

	Fixed handling of grid-mapfiles coming from client.
	Fixed support for nordugrid.
	Improvements to the monitoring.
	Improvements to the installer.
        Improved documentation.

v2_0	Refactoring creation libs;
	  create_frontend and create_glidein now share much code
	Added create_frontend, recreate_frontend.
	Frontend now has a stage web area and passes it to the factory
	  Factory publishes list of supported signtypes and
            frontend uses this for factory selection
	  User provided code in the glidein API changed
	    The 2nd arg is now one of main|entry|client|client_group
	Added tools/glidein_status.py.
	The monitoring page now has client-side monitoring based on
            javascriptRRD.
	Support multiple proxies... frontend drives this via plugins.

v1_6_3 Fixed a security bug in way certificate/proxy DN(s) are handled. If
          you are upgrading the installation rather than full install, you
          should patch the condor_mapfile used by Condor daemons in your
          installation using the convert_condormap tool available from the
          glideinWMS download page. For additional security, users should
          add new DN to the condor_mapfile only by using the glidecondor_addDN
