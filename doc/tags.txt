	NOTE-FRONTEND: The default Frontend tokens key is now variable, $HOME/passwords.d/UPPERCASE_USERNAME. There is no actual change since this is /var/lib/gwms-frontend/passwords.d/FRONTEND for normal RPM installations. (PR#504)
	NOTE-FACTORY: The new variable SINGULARITY_IMAGE_REQUIRED defaults to false and allows to use Singularity/Apptainer also when the configured image is not available. The image must be provided by the job or a future custom script in order not to fail. (PR#482)
	NOTE-FACTORY: APPTAINER_TEST_IMAGE can be set to an always available Singularity/Apptainer image to use for testing. Defaults to oras://ghcr.io/apptainer/alpine:latest (PR#482)

	Bug fix: Checking also the apptainer binary in the SINGULARITY_BIN path, not only singularity (PR#473)
	NOTE: The Glidein will always send SIGQUIT to HTCondor when it receives INT, TERM, QUIT signals. This speeds up the shutdown (PR#466)
	NOTE: Renamed Glidein Logging functions to glog_... (glog_init, glog_setup, glog_write, glog_send - PR#467). The original functions (log_init_tokens, log_init, log_setup, log_write, send_logs_to_remote, ...) are no more available
	NOTE: Apptainer downloaded in the HTCondor tar ball is now considered after the PATH in the search for a valid binary. The keyword CONDOR in the parameter SINGULARITY_BIN will make so that the HTCondor Apptainer is preferred ahead of the rest (PR#473)
	NOTE: Added RHEL9 to the list of default OSes used for the container images lookup. Now it is default,rhel9,rhel7,rhel6,rhel8 (PR#473)

v3_10_3
	Added support for Debian 11 and Ubuntu 22 worker nodes (PR#320)
	Added structured logging. It is a hybrid format with some fields followed by a JSON dictionary. The exact format of the messages may change in the future, and we plan for it to become the default. Now it is disabled by default. Add `structured="True"` to all `process_log` elements (PR#333)

	Bug fix: Fixed fetch_rrd crash in EL9 causing missing monitoring and glidefactoryclient classad information (Issue#338, PR#339)
	NOTE-FACTORY: When generating cvmfsexec distribution for EL9 machine type on an EL7 machine, the factory reconfig and/or upgrade fails as a result of an error in `create_cvmfsexec_distros.sh`. This is possibly due to the tools for EL7 being unable to handle EL9 files (as per Dave Dykstra). Please exercise caution if using `rhel9-x86_64` in the `mtypes` list for the `cvmfsexec_distro` tag in factory configuration. - Our workaround is to remove the EL9 machine type from the default list of machine types supported by the custom distros creation script.  Add it back if you are running on an EL9 system and want an EL9 cvmfsexec distrinution. (PR#312)'

	NOTE-FACTORY: The rebuilding of cvmfsexec distributions is now disabled by default, it must be enabled via the new factory knob.\ If you are upgrading from v3.9.5 or later, check that the cvmfsexec script is no more in the pre-reconfigure hooks directory.

v3_10_1
	Added utility function to replace error_gen in python scripts (PR#254)

	Bug fix: Working and local tmp directories are removed during Glidein cleanup also when the start directory is missing. This result in a loss of Glidein final status information but avoids sandbox leaks on the Worker Node. (issue#189)
	NOTE: custom scripts should always read values via gconfig_get(). The only exception is the parsing or the line to get the add_config_line source file
	NOTE: add_config_line is deprecated in favor of gconfig_add. Will be removed from future versions
	NOTE: add_config_line_safe is deprecated in favor of gconfig_add_safe. gconfig_add is the recommended method to use also in concurrent scripts
	NOTE: gconfig_add_unsafe, with a similar behavior to the former add_config_line, has been added. Its use is not recommended, unless absolutely sure that no script will be run in parallel
	NOTE: Only the first collector in TRUST_DOMAIN is kept, following collectors are removed. This happens both in the Frontend token issuer and in the setting of the Glidein TRUST_DOMAIN (setup_x509.sh).

          without using the installer. Upgrading condor binaries for user pool
          and the wms collector with multiple schedds should not be done without
          corresponding changes to the condor configuration file. If the

        Bug Fix: It is possible to specify limits for different frontends for
          an entry in the factory config
        Bug Fix: Glidein sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so condor uses local shared
          libraries before those in system path
        KNOWN ISSUE: When the monitor work_dir is moved, reconfig/upgrade will
          fail. Recommended work-around is to delete the xml configuration in
          the work directory, change the work directory, then reconfig/upgrade.
        KNOWN ISSUE: If the work directory has changed, frontend startup
          upgrade will not create the group directories and then the frontend
          will fail (silently). If you are changing directories (e.g. from a RPM
          upgrade), you should copy the group directories manually.

	Bug Fix: Installer now correctly works with the RPM OSG client
        Bug Fix: ReqMaxIdle was grossly overestimated before.
        Bug Fix: Fixed bug in factory monitoring web pages where the link
          generation was off by one for monitoring groups
        Bug Fix: Correctly respect the remove max_per_cycle=0 glideins in the
          factory
        Bug Fix: glexec_setup.sh now uses correct proxy for its tests

v2_5_4  Added support for VDT pre installed via rpm. While using
          ini-installer set vdt_location to empty and
          x509_cert_dir=/etc/grid-security/certificates
        Consolidated some of the frontend rpm related patches
        Added support for rsl in glideinWMS.xml to map to cream_attributes
          in the jdf
        Bug Fix: Factory now correctly renews the proxies if the limits are hit
        Bug Fix: frontend_startup does not show "upgrade" in help

        Made querying of schedds efficient where ever possible.
        Add autocomplete/search to table in frontendGroupGraphStatusNow.html
        Added 'upgrade' option to factory startup script so that all the
          files in the glidein submit directory are updated.  Did the same for
          the frontend startup script. 'reconfig' only updates the files
          populated with information from the configuration files (no scripts).
        The OSG rpm worker node client requires changes to glidein startup
          scripts. If you plan on using OSG sites that have used this rpm, you
          must "upgrade" your factory in order to get glideins.
        Bug fix: If there is no GLOBUS_LOCATION available to glidein, it will
          not exit
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where factory would not advertise the entry under
          certain conditions when it was put in downtime.
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where glidein_reconfig would not properly validate
          schedd_name
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where frontend reconfig was not populating
          GSI_DAEMON_PROXY correctly in frontend.condor_config
        Bug fix: Writeback of config files on reconfig is now enable by default
        Bug fix: Frontend does better error reporting when querying user pool or
          the schedd fails
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug in condor log parsing when we encounter event 400
          (Job was evicted)

          the limits correctly
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug in DAEMON_SHUTDOWN
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where voms requirements were not treated correctly
        Bug fix: Added glidecondor_upgrade back to the install dir. This file
          was missing in v2_5_2_1 release

v2_5_2_1Bug fix: Fixed a bug creation of START expression when VOMS proxy is
          set be required.
        Bug Fix: Revert the glidein shutdown behavior introduced in v2_5_2
        Bug Fix: Add condor_glexec_update_proxy to Condor tarball if available

v2_5_2  Frontend publishes glideresource classad to the pool collector. This
          is useful for the users to do match making for their jobs.
        Useful job info like JOB_Site, JOB_GLIDEIN_Entry_Name, JOB_GLIDEIN_Name
          JOB_GLIDEIN_Factory, JOB_GLIDEIN_Schedd, JOB_GLIDEIN_ClusterId,
          JOB_GLIDEIN_ProcId, JOB_GLIDEIN_Site is now added to SUBMIT_EXPRS
        Default GLEXEC_JOB = True when GLEXEC_BIN is set to use glexec
        Factory can now reuse old public key after startup to decrypt
          frontend requests. Grace time for old public key is configurable.
        The frontend now can set global limits on number of glideins.
        The frontend now can use more than a single CPU.
        glexec now tested during initial validation.
        Bug fix frontend: Do not double count glideins when using multiple
          groups.
        Bug fix frontend: Respect per-entry running limits.
        Bug fix factory: The factory was not properly checking the security
          classes and setting downtimes.
        Bug fix factory: Improper termination of glideins because of
          SIGHUP is handled correctly
        Bug fix factory: Daylight savings is now correctly accounted for.
        Bug fix factory: GLIDEIN_Max_Walltime is now used correctly.
        Major improvements in the factory and frontend monitoring.

        Added tools for comparing the Factory configuration file with what
          is published in information systems.
        Limit the max number of glideins per frontend
        Use DAEMON_SHUTDOWN to shutdown glidein daemons
        Allow factory to specify if an entry point (CE) requires voms proxies
          only for pilot and user jobs
        Documentation added:
          - Secondary WMS/User Collector documentation added to Advanced
          Condor Configuration
          - Documented the internal communication protocol through classads

v2_5_1  Factory now can remove excessive glideins
          New ClassAd attribute - RemoveExcess
        Frontend will request removal of glideins when no user jobs in queue
        Improved idle counting by the frontend when jobs match many factory
          entries.
        Improved frontend logging.
        Add Java support in the glideins.
        Changed factory monitoring. It is now based on security names and not
          plain frontend names

v2_5	Installer can now install gridFTP and VOMS certs needed by CREAM
	GlideinWMS release is now available in 3 different tarballs, frontend
	  only, factory only and a complete tarball.
	GlideinWMS factory and the Corral frontend can now talk to each other
	Factory is smarter about handling held glideins
	Factory can now black/white list VOs on a per-entry basis
	Version of GlideinWMS is now published in the classads. Scheme can
	  detect any changes to any service appropriate files and advertises
	  cersion as patched.
	Frontend should try to recover the crashed group before it gives up and
	  shutsdown
	Improvements to the monitoring
        Improvements to documentation
	Add support for use of TCP in condor_advertise
	Add support for condor_advertise -multiple (requires Condor v7.5.4+)
	Improved factory stopping procedure

	  INSTANCE FOR BOTH FACTORY AND FRONTEND
	Graceful shutdown of the glidein by trapping signals in glidein_startup
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where factory would create a malformed
	  glideinWMS.xml config file when configured to use a default proxy
	  for glideins from the factory.
	BUG FIX: Factory entry sometimes stops reporting when it gets an
	  exception for any reason
	BUG FIX: Top-level schedd_status.xml malformed Total data
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where the LogCounts.rrd was created with wrong
	  data types.
	KNOWN ISSUE: Automatic release of held glideins for CREAM CEs with
	  issues could result in factory submitting more than required
	  glideins to the CE. As a workaround, disable release of held glideins
	  for CREAM CE.

v2_4_3  Install VOMS Certificates during the install time
	Entry does not print stacktrace when it fails to submit glidein.
	  Instead it logs the error message appropriately.
	Default scripts run on the worker node correctly print errors to
	  stderr instead of stdout
	Allow factory to startup from any directory
	Python scripts get the python from /usr/bin/env python instead of
	  /bin/env python making them more portable across different linux
	  distros
	Better exception handling and error reporting
	Fixed how voms_proxy_init is looked for after VDT install
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where Summarize.listStored() in CondorMonitor.py
	  returned the wrong value
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug in factory monitoring that prevented proper
	  aggregation of sites
	BUG FIX: Correctly interpret DN from a voms proxy generated from a
	  service certificate.
	BUG FIX: Generate frontend's condor_config without empty values for
	  certain configuration options. Empty values is not the right way to

v2_4_2	Fixed the incompatibility introduced in v2_4_1 in monitoring components.

v2_4_1	Add a new configuration option for PREEMPT_GRACE_TIME
	Move configuration of GLIDEIN_Job_Max_Time from the factory to the
	  frontend
	In factory config added checks to make sure Factory configuration is
	  consistent w.r.t CONDOR_ARCH, CONDOR_VERSION, CONDOR_OS
	Monitoring enhancement to make selection/deselection of groups/entries
	  easier
	Support GLIDEIN_Glexec_Use in frontend config attrs. Frontend can
	  mandate or make the use of GLEXEC optional. Used in conjunction with
	  GLEXEC_BIN in factory config. If GLEXEC_BIN in set to NONE for an
	  entry in factory config, it is assumed that the entry doesn't have
	  GLEXEC configured on site.
	Improvements to documentation
	BUG FIX: Allow the use of the same DN for both the security and the
	  collector
	BUG FIX: Returning invalid variable during proxy creation
	KNOWN ISSUES: Running GlideinWMS v2_4_1 with Condor 7.5.3 has not been
	  tested. Although, most of the things may work, security changes in
	  Condor may affect your installation.


v2_4	Add proxy security classes to the frontend
	Add SecurityName to the frontend.
	Add DNs for frontend proxy and all the daemons the frontend talks to;
	  create own Condor config file and gldiein gridmap file out of them.

	Implement privilege separation in the factory.
	Various minor refactoring of code to achieve the above.
	Aggregate gatekeeper/sites for factory monitoring.
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

v2_3_2	Fixed a security bug in the way certificate/proxy DN(s) are handled. If
	  you are upgrading the installation rather than full install, you
	  should patch the condor_mapfile used by Condor daemons in your
	  installation using the convert_condormap tool available from the
	  GlideinWMS download page. For additional security, users should
	  add new DN to the condor_mapfile only by using the glidecondor_addDN
	  tool available in the GlideinWMS/install directory.

v2_3_1	Updated documentation. This is document change only release
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

v2_3	Attempt to restart a crashed entry few times before shutting down the
	  factory. Restarting is allowed for max restart_attempts in time
	  interval restart_interval sec in the factory.

	Fixed a logical bug in the glidein config that resulted in job preemption.
	Added support for condor_ssh (v7.4 and up)
	Add support for unquoted string to be published in classads. The type is 'expr'
	Documentation Changes
	Minor bugs fixed.
 	KNOWN ISSUES: If using condor 7.4.0-7.4.2 and 7.5.0, USE_VOMS_ATTRIBUTESshould be set to false for Collector and negotiator to avoid potential problems and memory leaks in GSI libraries.

v2_2	Bug Fix: GLEXEC_JOB and GLEXEC_STARTER were not published in glideins
          classads. This was preventing pseudo interactive monitoring to work
          in case of GLEXEC.
	Made VDT optional.
	Added support for VDT 2.0, and made it the default.
	  Added Globus-Client and Myproxy-Client in the minimal VDT install.

	Added support for multiple versions of condor in a single factory.
	Added ReqEncIdentity to the frontend->factory protocol
	   to prevent replay attacks.
	   WARNING: This effectively prevents old-style frontends to talk
                    to new style factories.
	   NOTE: Will only work with Condor 7.3.1 or newer
	KNOWN ISSUES: Pseudo interactive monitoring will not work with glexec.

v2_0	Refactoring creation libs;
	  create_frontend and create_glidein now share much code
	Added create_frontend, recreate_frontend.
	Frontend now has a stage web area and passes it to the factory
	  Factory publishes list of supported signtypes and
            frontend uses this for factory selection
	  User provided code in the glidein API changed
	    The 2nd arg is now one of main|entry|client|client_group
	Added tools/glidein_status.py.
	The monitoring page now has client-side monitoring based on
            javascriptRRD.
	Support multiple proxies... frontend drives this via plugins.

v1_6_3 Fixed a security bug in way certificate/proxy DN(s) are handled. If
          you are upgrading the installation rather than full install, you
          should patch the condor_mapfile used by Condor daemons in your
          installation using the convert_condormap tool available from the
          GlideinWMS download page. For additional security, users should
          add new DN to the condor_mapfile only by using the glidecondor_addDN
          tool available in the glideinWMS/install directory.
