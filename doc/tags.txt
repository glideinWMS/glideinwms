	  for CREAM CE.

v2_4_3  Install VOMS Certificates during the install time
	Entry does not print stacktrace when it fails to submit glidein.
	  Instead it logs the error message appropriately.
	Default scripts run on the worker node correctly print errors to
	  stderr instead of stdout

	  entry in factory config, it is assumed that the entry doesn't have
	  GLEXEC configured on site.
	Improvements to documentation
	BUG FIX: Allow the use of the same DN for both the security and the
	  collector
	BUG FIX: Returning invalid variable during proxy creation
	KNOWN ISSUES: Running glideinWMS v2_4_1 with Condor 7.5.3 has not been
	  tested. Altough, most of the things may work, security changes in
	  Condor may affect your installation.


v2_4	Add proxy security classes to the frontend
	Add SecurityName to the frontend.
	Add DNs for frontend proxy and all the daemons the frontend talks to;

	Various minor refactoring of code to achieve the above.
	Aggregate gatekeeper/sites for factory monitoring. 
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct 
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not 
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

v2_3_2	Fixed a security bug in the way certificate/proxy DN(s) are handled. If
	  you are upgrading the installation rather than full install, you
	  should patch the condor_mapfile used by Condor daemons in your
	  installation using the convert_condormap tool available from the
	  glideinWMS download page. For additional security, users should
	  add new DN to the condor_mapfile only by using the glidecondor_addDN 
	  tool available in the glideinWMS/install directory.

v2_3_1	Updated documentation. This is document change only release
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct 
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not 
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

	Fixed a logical bug in the glidein config that resulted in job preemption.
	Added support for condor_ssh (v7.4 and up)
	Add support for unquoted string to be published in classads. The type is 'expr'
	Documentation Changes
	Minor bugs fixed.
 	KNOWN ISSUES: If using condor 7.4.0-7.4.2 and 7.5.0, USE_VOMS_ATTRIBUTESshould be set to false for Collector and negotiator to avoid potential problems and memory leaks in GSI libraries.

v2_2	Bug Fix: GLEXEC_JOB and GLEXEC_STARTER were not published in glideins
          classds. This was preventing psuedo interactive monitoring to work
          in case of GLEXEC.
	Made VDT optional.
	Addedd support for VDT 2.0, and made it the default.
	  Added Globus-Client and Myproxy-Client in the minimal VDT install.

	   to prevent replay attacks.
	   WARNING: This effectively prevents old-style frontends to talk
                    to new style factories.
	   NOTE: Will only work with Condor 7.3.1 or newer
	KNOWN ISSUES: Pseudo interactive monitoring will not work with glexec.

	Fixed handling of grid-mapfiles coming from client.
	Fixed support for nordugrid.
	Improvements to the monitoring.

        Improved documentation.

v2_0	Refactoring creation libs;
	  create_frontend and create_glidein now share much code
	Added create_frontend, recreate_frontend.
	Frontend now has a stage web area and passes it to the factory
	  Factory publishes list of supported signtypes and
            frontend uses this for factory selection

	    The 2nd arg is now one of main|entry|client|client_group
	Added tools/glidein_status.py.
	The monitoring page now has client-side monitoring based on
            javascriptRRD.
	Support multiple proxies... frontend drives this via plugins.

v1_6_3 Fixed a security bug in way certificate/proxy DN(s) are handled. If
          you are upgrading the installation rather than full install, you
          should patch the condor_mapfile used by Condor daemons in your
          installation using the convert_condormap tool available from the
          glideinWMS download page. For additional security, users should
          add new DN to the condor_mapfile only by using the glidecondor_addDN
