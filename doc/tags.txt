v3_9_6
	Added token authentication to Glideins running in the Cloud (AWS and GCE). Now Glideins on all supported resources can authenticate back using IDTOKENS when using recent HTCSS versions.
	Added `GLIDEIN_PERIODIC_SCRIPT` env variable to notify periodic custom scripts
	Added the possibility to set the Glidein HTCSS TRUST_DOMAIN as attribute in the Frontend configuration
	The Frontend configuration is now valid (reconfig/upgrade successful) even if some HTCSS schedds are not in DNS. Failing only if all schedds are unknown to DNS
	Bug fix: Fixed `glidien_config` corrupted by concurrent custom scripts run via HTCSS startd cron (#163)
	Bug fix: Fixed `setup_x509.sh` not to write to stdout when running as periodic script in HTCSS start cron (issues

	Bug fix: Unset SEC_PASSWORD_DIRECTORY in the Glidein HTCSS configuration, was causing warnings for unknown files (PR
	Bug fix: HTCSS DC_DAEMON_LIST now is equal to DAEMON_LIST only in the Factory, in all other GlideinWMS components only selected HTCSS daemons are added explicitly to it (issue
	Bug fix: Working and local tmp directories are removed during Glidein cleanup also when the start directory is missing. This result in a loss of Glidein final status information but avoids sandbox leaks on the Worker Node. (issue
	NOTE: custom scripts should always read values via gconfig_get(). The only exception is the parsing or the line to get the add_config_line source file
	NOTE: add_config_line is deprecated in favor of gconfig_add. Will be removed from future versions
	NOTE: add_config_line_safe is deprecated in favor of gconfig_add_safe. gconfig_add is the recommended method to use also in concurrent scripts
	NOTE: gconfig_add_unsafe, with a similar behavior to the former add_config_line, has been added. Its use is not recommended, unless absolutely sure that no script will be run in parallel
	NOTE: Only the first collector in TRUST_DOMAIN is kept, following collectors are removed. This happens both in the Frontend token issuer and in the setting of the Glidein TRUST_DOMAIN (setup_x509.sh).

        Bug Fix: Factory now correctly does accounting of glideins in default
          condor schedd
        Bug Fix: proxy_info works correctly with the cat option

v2_7    glideinwms code is now organized as python packages
        Factory no longer creates long running process per entry. Instead, it
          runs only a single long running glideFactoryEntryGroup process
          instead of multiple glideFactoryEntry processes. Factory config
          supports two additional config attributes entry_parallel_workers
          and update_thread_count (see factory configuration docs for details)
        Improved factory prerformance by migrating popen calls to use python's
          subprocess library
        Improved the performance of the Frontend by using pre-clustering in
          the Frontend match-making
        Created index.html for factory monitoring so that admins can disable
          directory browsing in httpd.conf
        Added support for Partitionable condor slots in the glidein
        Frontend policy for matching factory classads is now exposed in
          glideresource classads
        Added a tool to dynamically create a secondary schedd config files
          and directories to the existing installation
        Improved the usability of the frontendGrouGraphStatusNow monitoring
        Factory now ships with two new operations tools: entry_ls and entry_rm
        Improved documentation
        Factory will now try to recover glideins with held code 79
        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where installers were not setting
          SHARED_PORT_MAX_WORKERS in respective condor_config correctly
        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where the frontend would match jobs with now
          proxy to sites that require glexec
        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where the factory entry processes and the frontend
          group (element) processes would inherit their parent's environment
          corrupting their own environment
        Bug Fix: Glidein's job wrapper now behaves as true wrapper
        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where frontend_startup would not correctly pick
          default frontend.xml
        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in frontend where failure to evaluate match_expr
          for one group would prevent frontend from requesting glideins for
          other groups
        Bug Fix: RPM now has shared port daemon enabled in the configuration
        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where Factory would sometime use wrong DN when
          calculating proxy hash
        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where factoryStatusNow.html would not link to the
          factoryEntryStatusNow.html correctly if the entry name is too long
        Bug Fix: setup_x509.sh now correctly checks for existence of the
          grid-proxy-info and voms-proxy-info binaries on the worker node
        Bug Fix: Frontend now counts the partitionable slots correctly

v2_6_2  Factory now supports glidein failure modes. This information is
          propagated back to the factory.
        Glideins now have different idle timeouts for startup and tail. The
          glideins now exit much faster after comleting jobs and they do not
          have enough time left to run another job.
        Added support for javascriptRRD 2.6.2
        Consolidate the condor_tarball tag in glideinwms.xml to read in a list
          of os, arch, version. See docs for details.
        Ini-installer will default collector_port to 9618 if not specified in
          appropriate config sections.
        Installation now supports GRIDMANAGER_PROXY_REFRESH_TIME for condorg
          services
        Improved logging when frontend fails to evaluate match expressions.
        Monitoring pages changed to be even more compliant with DOM4
        Improved the means for distributing condor config files for different
          condor services.
        Improved documentation.
        Bug Fix: Better handling of monitor dir during upgrade
        Bug Fix: Factory correctlt handles frontend in downtime and now it does
          not affect requests from other frontends
        Bug Fix: Putting entry in downtime multiple times now warns the user
        Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where v2.6.1 frontend would crash under certain
        Bug Fix: Installers do not set CONDOR_VERSION as constant by default.
          This will now enable frontends to override this attr.
        Bug Fix: Ini-installer now correctly cleans up files on re-install

v2_6_1  Factory now limits the speed at which it releases held glideins. After
          too many unrecoverable attempts, held glideins are removed.
        Added support for Condor 7.8+
          KNOWN ISSUE: Only applies if you upgrade condor binaries in place
          without using the installer. Upgrading condor binaries for user pool
          and the wms collector with multiple schedds should not be done without
          corresponding changes to the condor configuration file. If the
          JOB_QUEUE_LOG is not correctly configured for each sched, condor
          queue will be corrupted for all the scheds
        Glideins now support curl & data file transfer plugins in condor
        New installations of factory and frontend services now communicate with
          condor daemons using TCP by default.
        Bug Fix: Factory configuration now supports specifying limits for
          different security classes of same frontend
          KNOWN ISSUE: If limits are configured in the factory, this change
          breaks backward compatibility. As a workaround, admin needs to remove
          the limits and re-apply them.
        Bug Fix: Factory monitoring pages now correctly work in Firefox 14+
        Bug Fix: Frontend now monitors the glideins correctly when the
          corresponding factory classad is missing
        Bug Fix: Fixed factory logging. Factory can now correctly extract info
          from a voms proxy
        Bug Fix: Factory now correctly logs the Completed jobs info in rrd

v2_6    Add attr_dict in the environment of the frontend match_expr
        Config defined attributes are now available in match_expr
        Factory now supports deleting entries using --force_delete
        Upgrading glideinwms with changes to the monitoring rrds is supported
        Frontend advertises its monitoring url to the factory
        Misbehaving glidein can be put on hold using WANT_HOLD
        The start_expr is now a native part of match
        Startd now advertises per-slot memory when configured by the factory.
          VO frontend can use GLIDEIN_MaxMemMBs_Estimate attr to make glidein
          estimate the available memory (based on memory/core or memory/cpu)
        entry_q now reads GLIDEIN_FACTORY_DIR from env before checking cwd
        Multiple user collectors are supported in HA mode
        Factory can specify if glexec required vs provided by site
        Providing config file locations for glideinwms.xml and frontend.xml is
          optional during reconfig
        Entry downtime reason is now reported in the glidefactory classad
        Improved support for RHEL 6 platform
        Added support for new ARC Gatekeeper 1.x
        Linux distro of the worker node is available in the glidein's classad
        Condor classad fields are now considered case insensitive
        Bug Fix: Java is correctly disable by default preventing increase in
          the image size during condor daemon benchmarking
        Bug Fix: Glidein correctly handles semicolons in STARTER_JOB_ENVIRONMENT
        Bug Fix: Frontend correctly correctly supports <attr> properties
        Bug Fix: Glidein now correctly finds glexec on glite site
        Bug Fix: Glideins update the user collector using TCP by default
        Bug Fix: Ini-Installer now correctly works with condor tarball on RHEL6
        Bug Fix: Reduced the logging in factory generated by inactive entries
        Bug Fix: For frontend rpm, init.d scriptes now correctly sudo to the
          frontend user before reconfig
        Bug Fix: Any errors due to changes in condor_q output are logged
        Bug Fix: MaxJobRetirementTime and PREEMPT expressions now correctly
          work with WANT_HOLD
        Bug Fix: Factory correctly deals with the situation when the frontend
          changes the proxy used
        Bug Fix: It is possible to specify limits for different frontends for
          an entry in the factory config
        Bug Fix: Glidein sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so condor uses local shared
          libraries before those in system path
        KNOWN ISSUE: When the monitor work_dir is moved, reconfig/upgrade will
          fail. Recommended work-around is to delete the xml configuration in
          the work directory, change the work directory, then reconfig/upgrade.
        KNOWN ISSUE: If the work directory has changed, frontend startup
          upgrade will not create the group directories and then the frontend
          will fail (silently). If you are changing directories (e.g. from a RPM
          upgrade), you should copy the group directories manually.


v2_5_7
	Patch of the clean_glidein_queue to return 1 only when something was
	  really done

v2_5_5	Added filtering to analyze_entries
	Reduced the number of debug log messages when entry becomes inactive.
	Frontend match making uses autoclusters, greatly increasing the
	  performance for busy frontends
	Package the list of shared libraries required by Condor 7.7.3+ for
	  glidein tarballs
	Pilot proxy is not available in the user job environment any more
	  reducing the chance for user job using it.
	Ini Installer caan now create a tmeplate for single service installs

	Bug Fix: GLIDEIN_Glexec_Use=NEVER setting now correctly works with the
	 setting require_voms_proxy=True
	Bug Fix: Installer now correctly works with the RPM OSG client
        Bug Fix: ReqMaxIdle was grossly overestimated before.
        Bug Fix: Fixed bug in factory monitoring web pages where the link
          generation was off by one for monitoring groups
        Bug Fix: Correctly respect the remove max_per_cycle=0 glideins in the
          factory
        Bug Fix: glexec_setup.sh now uses correct proxy for its tests

v2_5_4  Added support for VDT pre installed via rpm. While using
          ini-installer set vdt_location to empty and
          x509_cert_dir=/etc/grid-security/certificates
        Consolidated some of the frontend rpm related patches
        Added support for rsl in glideinWMS.xml to map to cream_attributes
          in the jdf
        Bug Fix: Factory now correctly renews the proxies if the limits are hit
        Bug Fix: frontend_startup does not show "upgrade" in help

          stopped under certain conditions

v2_5_3  Updated the license to reflect current Fermitools license
        Factory does a better job at respecting frontend limits
        Admins can add custom html to the monitoring pages
        Monitoring now displays additional information about the Factory and
          Frontend names
        Improved documentation
        Enable Match Authentication configuration by default
        Made quering of schedds efficient where ever possible.
        Add autocomplete/search to table in frontendGroupGraphStatusNow.html
        Added 'upgrade' option to factory startup script so that all the
          files in the glidein submit directory are updated.  Did the same for
          the frontend startup script. 'reconfig' only updates the files
          populated with information from the configuration files (no scripts).
        The OSG rpm worker node client requires changes to glidein startup
          scripts. If you plan on using OSG sites that have used this rpm, you
          must "upgrade" your factory in order to get glideins.
        Bug fix: If there is no GLOBUS_LOCATION available to glidein, it will
          not exit
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where factory would not advertise the entry under
          certain conditions when it was put in downtime.
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where glidein_reconfig would not properly validate
          schedd_name
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where frontend reconfig was not populating
          GSI_DAEMON_PROXY correctly in frontend.condor_config
        Bug fix: Writeback of config files on reconfig is now enable by default
        Bug fix: Frontend does better error reporting when quering user pool or
          the schedd fails
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug in condor log parsing when we encounter event 400
          (Job was evicted)
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where factory would not correctly accept requests
          from frontends that were still using old keys
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where glidein pilot proxy lifetime was not taken
          into account vs GLIDEIN_Max_Walltime
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where expired/renewed proxy created error in
          completed_jobs accounting
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where running_glideins_per_entry was not treating
          the limits correctly
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug in DAEMON_SHUTDOWN
        Bug fix: Fixed a bug where voms requirements were not treated correctly
        Bug fix: Added glidecondor_upgrade back to the install dir. This file
          was missing in v2_5_2_1 release

v2_5_2_1Bug fix: Fixed a bug creation of START expression when VOMS proxy is
          set be required.
        Bug Fix: Revert the glidein shutdown behavior introduced in v2_5_2
        Bug Fix: Add condor_glexec_update_proxy to Condor tarball if available

v2_5_2  Frontend publishes glideresource classad to the pool collector. This
          is useful for the users to do match making for their jobs.
        Useful job info like JOB_Site, JOB_GLIDEIN_Entry_Name, JOB_GLIDEIN_Name
          JOB_GLIDEIN_Factory, JOB_GLIDEIN_Schedd, JOB_GLIDEIN_ClusterId,
          JOB_GLIDEIN_ProcId, JOB_GLIDEIN_Site is now added to SUBMIT_EXPRS
        Default GLEXEC_JOB = True when GLEXEC_BIN is set to use glexec
        Factory can now resue old public key after startup to decrypt
          frontend requests. Grace time for old public key is configurable.
        The frontend now can set global limits on number of glideins.
        The frontend now can use more than a single CPU.
        glexec now tested during initial validation.
        Bug fix frontend: Do not double count glideins when using multiple
          groups.
        Bug fix frontend: Respect per-entry running limits.
        Bug fix factory: The factory was not properly checking the security
          classes and setting downtimes.
        Bug fix factory: Improper termination of glideins because of
          SIGHUP is handled correctly
        Bug fix factory: Daylight savings is now correctly accounted for.
        Bug fix factory: GLIDEIN_Max_Walltime is now used correctly.
        Major improvements in the factory and frontend monitoring.
          Now requires javascriptRRD 0.6.0+.
        Added tools for comparing the Factory configuration file with what
          is published in information systems.
        Limit the max number of glideins per frontend
        Use DAEMON_SHUTDOWN to shutdown glidein daemons
        Allow factory to specify if an entry point (CE) requires voms proxies
          only for pilot and user jobs
        Documentation added:
          - Secondary WMS/User Collector documentation added to Advanced
          Condor Configuration
          - Documented the internal communication protocol through classads

v2_5_1  Factory now can remove excessive glideins
          New ClassAd attribute - RemoveExcess
        Frontend will request removal of glideins when no user jobs in queue
        Improved idle counting by the frontend when jobs match many factory
          entries.
        Improved frontend logging.
        Add Java support in the glideins.
        Changed factory monitoring. It is now based on security names and not
          plain frontend names
        Improved installation process using ini based installer.
        GlideinWMS tarball does not include CVS directories and files any more
        Added support of shared port configuration for condor daemons
        SIGHUP signals to glideins are ignored correctly.
        Improved documentation
        BUG FIX: Fixed a bug introduced in v2_5 release where reconfiguring the
          factory would fail because of monitoring groups
        BUG FIX: Fixed a typo in one of the links in frontendRRDBrowse.html

v2_5	Installer can now install gridFTP and VOMS certs needed by CREAM
	GlideinWMS release is now available in 3 different tarballs, frontend
	  only, factory only and a complete tarball.
	GlideinWMS factory and the Corral frontend can now talk to each other
	Factory is smarter about handling held glideins
	Factory can now black/white list VOs on a per-entry basis
	Version of GlideinWMS is now published in the classads. Scheme can
	  detect any changes to any service appropriate files and advertises
	  cersion as patched.
	Frontend should try to recover the crashed group before it gives up and
	  shutsdown
	Improvements to the monitoring
        Improvements to documentaion
	Add support for use of TCP in condor_advertise
	Add support for condor_advertise -multiple (requires Condor v7.5.4+)
	Improved factory stopping procedure
	Add XML monitoring files of RRD files on both factory and frontend
	Add JobsRunningHere attribute - CANNOT SIMPLY UPGRADE, NEEDS NEW
	  INSTANCE FOR BOTH FACTORY AND FRONTEND
	Graceful shutdown of the glidein by trapping signals in glidein_startup
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where factory would create a malformed
	  glideinWMS.xml config file when configured to use a default proxy
	  for glideins from the factory.
	BUG FIX: Factory entry sometimes stops reporting when it gets an
	  exception for any reason
	BUG FIX: Top-level schedd_status.xml malformed Total data
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where the LogCounts.rrd was created with wrong
	  data types.
	KNOWN ISSUE: Automatic release of held glideins for CREAM CEs with
	  issues could result in factory submitting more than required
	  glideins to the CE. As a workaround, disable release of held glideins
	  for CREAM CE.

v2_4_3  Install VOMS Certificates during the install time
	Entry does not print stacktrace when it fails to submit glidein.
	  Instead it logs the error message appropriately.
	Default scripts run on the worker node correctly print errors to
	  stderr instead of stdout
	Allow factory to startup from any directory
	Python scripts get the python from /usr/bin/env python instead of
	  /bin/env python making them more portable accross different linux
	  distros
	Better exception handling and error reporting
	Fixed how voms_proxy_init is looked for after VDT install
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where Summarize.listStored() in CondorMonitor.py
	  returned the wrong value
	BUG FIX: Fixed a bug in factory monitoring that prevented proper
	  aggregation of sites
	BUG FIX: Correctly interpret DN from a voms proxy generated from a
	  service certificate.
	BUG FIX: Generate frontend's condor_config without empty values for
	  certain configuration options. Empty values is not the right way to
	  reset the configuration options.


v2_4_2	Fixed the incompatibility introduced in v2_4_1 in monitoring components.

v2_4_1	Add a new configuration option for PREEMPT_GRACE_TIME
	Move configuration of GLIDEIN_Job_Max_Time from the factory to the
	  frontend
	In factory config added checks to make sure Factory configuration is
	  consistent w.r.t CONDOR_ARCH, CONDOR_VERSION, CONDOR_OS
	Monitoring enhancement to make selection/deselection of groups/entries
	  easier
	Support GLIDEIN_Glexec_Use in frontend config attrs. Frontend can
	  mandate or make the use of GLEXEC optional. Used in conjunction with
	  GLEXEC_BIN in factory config. If GLEXEC_BIN in set to NONE for an
	  entry in factory config, it is assumed that the entry doesn't have
	  GLEXEC configured on site.
	Improvements to documentation
	BUG FIX: Allow the use of the same DN for both the security and the
	  collector
	BUG FIX: Returning invalid variable during proxy creation
	KNOWN ISSUES: Running GlideinWMS v2_4_1 with Condor 7.5.3 has not been
	  tested. Altough, most of the things may work, security changes in
	  Condor may affect your installation.


v2_4	Add proxy security classes to the frontend
	Add SecurityName to the frontend.
	Add DNs for frontend proxy and all the daemons the frontend talks to;
	  create own Condor config file and gldiein gridmap file out of them.
	Frontend now dynalically creates GLIDEIN_Collector.
	Frontend now requires Match authentication.
	Add frontend autentication info to the factory config.
	Add support for different frontend identities in different WMS
	  collectors.
	Put log files in a separate tree.
	Put client logs and client proxies in separate trees.
	Implement privilege separation in the factory.
	Various minor refactoring of code to achieve the above.
	Aggregate gatekeeper/sites for factory monitoring.
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

v2_3_2	Fixed a security bug in the way certificate/proxy DN(s) are handled. If
	  you are upgrading the installation rather than full install, you
	  should patch the condor_mapfile used by Condor daemons in your
	  installation using the convert_condormap tool available from the
	  GlideinWMS download page. For additional security, users should
	  add new DN to the condor_mapfile only by using the glidecondor_addDN
	  tool available in the GlideinWMS/install directory.

v2_3_1	Updated documentation. This is document change only release
	Introduced monitoringgroups to group sites together for monitoring
	  purposes in factory.
	KNOWN ISSUES: Installer is not always able to get the correct
	  DN from the certificates/proxies. It does not correctly strip the
	  CN=<blah> bit of the DN in certain cases. If the DN guessed is not
	  correct, make the required changes in the configurations and/or
	  condor_mapfile.

v2_3	Attempt to restart a crashed entry few times before shutting down the
	  factory. Restarting is allowed for max restart_attempts in time
	  interval restart_interval sec in te factory.
	Add vacuum option to manageDowntimes.
	Factory now properly handles new-style frontends without a group.
	Frontend code has been refactored to allow use as a library.
	More protections in place.
        Fixed a security bug in key handling. BREAKES BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY! But it is needed.
	Fixed a bug in glidein_startup.sh that prevented the passing of * as a parameter value
	Fixed a logical bug in the glidein config that resulted in job preemption.
	Added support for condor_ssh (v7.4 and up)
	Add support for unquoted string to be published in classads. The type is 'expr'
	Documentation Changes
	Minor bugs fixed.
 	KNOWN ISSUES: If using condor 7.4.0-7.4.2 and 7.5.0, USE_VOMS_ATTRIBUTESshould be set to false for Collector and negotiator to avoid potential problems and memory leaks in GSI libraries.

v2_2	Bug Fix: GLEXEC_JOB and GLEXEC_STARTER were not published in glideins
          classds. This was preventing psuedo interactive monitoring to work
          in case of GLEXEC.
	Made VDT optional.
	Addedd support for VDT 2.0, and made it the default.
	  Added Globus-Client and Myproxy-Client in the minimal VDT install.
	Installer now allows the collector to run on non-standard port.
	Factory now only checks X509_USER_PROXY if it needs it.
	Added support for multiple versions of condor in a single factory.
	Added ReqEncIdentity to the frontend->factory protocol
	   to prevent replay attacks.
	   WARNING: This effectively prevents old-style frontends to talk
                    to new style factories.
	   NOTE: Will only work with Condor 7.3.1 or newer
	KNOWN ISSUES: Pseudo interactive monitoring will not work with glexec.

v2_1	Fixed a bug that was throwing an exception if a glidein failed.
	Fixed handling of grid-mapfiles coming from client.
	Fixed support for nordugrid.
	Improvements to the monitoring.
	Improvements to the installer.
        Improved documentation.

v2_0	Refactoring creation libs;
	  create_frontend and create_glidein now share much code
	Added create_frontend, recreate_frontend.
	Frontend now has a stage web area and passes it to the factory
	  Factory publishes list of supported signtypes and
            frontend uses this for factory selection
	  User provided code in the glidein API changed
	    The 2nd arg is now one of main|entry|client|client_group

v1_6_3 Fixed a security bug in way certificate/proxy DN(s) are handled. If
          you are upgrading the installation rather than full install, you
          should patch the condor_mapfile used by Condor daemons in your
          installation using the convert_condormap tool available from the
          GlideinWMS download page. For additional security, users should
          add new DN to the condor_mapfile only by using the glidecondor_addDN
          tool available in the glideinWMS/install directory.
