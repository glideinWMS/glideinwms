The GlideinWMS development been sponsored
by Fermi Research Alliance, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC02-07CH11359 with the
U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of High Energy Physics,
and by the [CMS collaboration](https://cms.cern/collaboration).

The initial version of GlideinWMS (v1.0) was heavily based on the CDF glidekeeper code:
http://indico.cern.ch/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=147&sessionId=8&confId=048.  
The development of that code was jointly funded by INFN, Fermilab and UCSD.

GlideinWMS heavily relies on HTCondor:
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/.  
The support of the Condor team was invaluable in the realization of GlideinWMS.
