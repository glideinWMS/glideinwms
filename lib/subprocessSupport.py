    Fork a process and execute cmd - rewritten to use select to avoid filling
    up stderr and stdout queues.

    The useShell value of True should be used sparingly.  It allows for
    executing commands that need access to shell features such as pipes,
    filename wildcards.  Refer to the python manual for more information on
    this.  When used, the 'cmd' string is not tokenized.

    One possible improvement would be to add a function to accept
    an array instead of a command string.

    Args:
        cmd (str): String containing the entire command including all arguments
        useShell (bool): if True run the command in a shell (passed to Popen as shell)
        stdin_data (str/bytes): Data that will be fed to the command via stdin. It will be bytes if text is False,
            str otherwise
        child_env (dict): Environment to be set before execution
        text (bool): if False, then stdin_data and the return value are bytes instead of str (default: True)

    Returns:
        str/bytes: output of the command. It will be bytes if text is False,
            str otherwise
