# Project:
#   glideinWMS
#
# Description:
#   Script to be periodically executed to check if the WN
#   is in draining mode.
#
#   The script implements one of the use case forseen by the
#   WLCG Machine / Job Features Task Force :
#   https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/MachineJobFeatures
#
#   The script check the existance of the shutdowntime_job file
#   in the $JOBFEATURES directory (or shutdowntime in $MACHINEFEATURES).
#   If one of the files is present then a shutdown is scheduled
#   based on the timestamp in that file.
#   $JOBFEATURES/shutdowntime_job ($MACHINEFEATURES/shutdowntime) could also
#   be a URL that the script tries to download.
#   The script checks the shutdown time contaned in the file and:
#     1. if less than 4h left, it will output "SiteWMS_WN_Draining = True" so the
#        pilot will stop accepting jobs.
#     2. if less than 30 minutes are left before it, then it will preempt the job
#        by setting "SiteWMS_WN_Preempt = True"
#   If one of the two files contains a non numeric value the script will exit
#   leaving everything untouched (it considers this an error)
#   More details about this:
