[Storage]
;
; Several of these values are constrained and need to be set in a way
; that is consistent with one of the OSG storage models
;
; Please refer to the OSG release documentation for an indepth explanation 
; of the various storage models and the requirements for them

; If you have a SE available for your cluster and wish to make it available 
; to incoming jobs, set se_available to True, otherwise set it to False
se_available = FALSE

; If you indicated that you have an se available at your cluster, set default_se to
; the hostname of this SE, otherwise set default_se to UNAVAILABLE
default_se = UNAVAILABLE

; The grid_dir setting should point to the directory which holds the files 
; from the OSG worker node package, it should be visible on all of the computer
; nodes (read access is required, worker nodes don't need to be able to write) 
; 
; For RPM installations, /etc/osg/wn-client is the correct location
grid_dir = /etc/osg/wn-client/

; The app_dir setting should point to the directory which contains the VO 
; specific applications, this should be visible on both the CE and worker nodes
; but only the CE needs to have write access to this directory
;
; This corresponds to the OSG_APP environment variable in jobs. Set
; this to UNSET to explicitly unset it
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
app_dir = /opt/osg/app
data_dir = /opt/osg/data
worker_node_temp = /tmp

; The data_dir setting should point to a directory that can be used to store 
; and stage data in and out of the cluster.  This directory should be readable
; and writable on both the CE and worker nodes
; 
; as scratch space on compute nodes, it should allow read and write access on the 
; worker nodes but can be local to each worker node
; 
; If you have setup your job manager to dynamically set this for jobs, set this 
; to UNAVAILABLE.  However, you must make sure that this variable is set when
; OSG jobs run otherwise jobs will most likely fail
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS

; The site_read setting should be the location or url to a directory that can 
; be read to stage in data, this is an url if you are using a SE 
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
site_read = UNAVAILABLE

; The site_write setting should be the location or url to a directory that can 
; be write to stage out data, this is an url if you are using a SE 
; 
; YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THIS
site_write = UNAVAILABLE
