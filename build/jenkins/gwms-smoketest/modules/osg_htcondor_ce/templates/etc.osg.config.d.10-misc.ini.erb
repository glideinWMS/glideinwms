; Should osg-configure edit /etc/lcmaps.db to configure authorization?
; Set this to False if you've made manual changes to /etc/lcmaps.db that you
; would like osg-configure to preserve

; This setting should be set to one of the following: vomsmap, xacml, gridmap
; to indicate whether a voms-mapfile, gums with xacml, or gridmap files should be used
;
; By default, this is set to vomsmap. Using gums with xacml requires a gums_host to be
; specified. However, gums is deprecated in OSG 3.4.

; Should vomsmap authorization look at all FQANs in a VOMS proxy or just the
; first? Default is just the first

; This setting should be set to the host used for gums host.
; If your site is not using a gums host, you can set this to DEFAULT
;gums_host = DEFAULT

; Some OSG services (e.g., GUMS, RSV, OSG Info Services) require special service
; certificate-key pairs.  The service certificate and key files must be owned by
; the user that runs the corresponding service (e.g., "tomcat" for GUMS and OSG
; Info Services, or "rsv" for RSV).  It is best to obtain separate service
; certificates for this purpose.  However, if you want osg-configure to copy
; your host certificate-key pair for each service certificate-key pair that does
; not exist, set copy_host_cert_for_service_certs to True; otherwise, it
; defaults to False.  NOTE: Having multiple copies of a private key owned by
; separate users decreases the security of the private key.
