# GlideinWMS Changelog

Developers updated changelog. For curated release notes see doc/tags.yaml or https://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.prd/history.html

## v3.9.6 \[2022-07-dd\]

Changes since the last release

### New features / functionalities

-   Added `GLIDEIN_PERIODIC_SCRIPT` env variable: when set custom scripts run periodically, started by HTCSS startd cron

### Changed defaults / behaviours

-   Frontend configuration valid (reconfig/upgrade successful) even if some HTCSS schedds are not in DNS. Failing only if all schedds are unknown to DNS.

### Deprecated / removed options and commands

-   To make `glidein_config` more robust and resistant to concurrent interactions the handling function to use in custom scripts have been updated:
    -   `add_config_line`, `add_config_line_safe` and custom parsing or writing from/to `glidein_config` are deprecated and will be removed form future versions (a change in format will make custom read not work correctly)
    -   `gconfig_add` and `gconfig_add_safe` replace the current `add_config_line` and `add_config_line_safe` respectively
    -   `gconfig_get` should be used to retrieve values form `glidein_config`
    -   During the transition period both new and old functions will work

### Security Related Fixes

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed `glidien_config` corrupted by concurrent custom scripts run via HTCSS startd cron (#163)

### Testing / Development

### Known Issues

## Template

This template section should stay at the bottom of the document.
Whenever a new release is cut, the section title should change, empty subsections removed, and a new "Changes Since Last Release" with the template subsections added on top.
This should be a description of the changes, not a Git log. Operators and users affecting changes are especially important to highlight.
Please classify the code changes using the listed subsections. If a new one is needed, add it also to the template.
