===============

glideinWMS is heavily based on the CDF glidekeeper code:
http://indico.cern.ch/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=147&sessionId=8&confId=048
The development of that code was jointly funded by INFN, Fermilab and UCSD.

glideinWMS heavily relies on Condor:

The support of the Condor team was invaluable in the realization of glideinWMS.
